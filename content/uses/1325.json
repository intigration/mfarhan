Installation of two new pressure transmitters at inlet manifold &amp; separator area at EPF facility was also required. EPF control room had two, dual screen operator stations which were connected to process control network via redundant Ethernet switches. HMI functionality was to be shifted to the CPF\u2019s CCR (central control room) on a standalone basis, whilst EPF PAS\/SIS control system and Engineering workstation would reside at their original location in EPF control room.<\/p>\n<p>INTECH proposed and carried out the following changes successfully completing the project well ahead of the project schedule:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>EPF HMI network to be extended to CPF via Ethernet over FO<\/li>\n<li>Two new pressure transmitters to be installed in the HIPPS system on EPF. One in Separator area and the other in Inlet Manifold.<\/li>\n<li>F&amp;G panel will be moved from EPF to CPF. Loop extenders will be used to extend the existing loop to CPF.
