Green and Blue Hydrogen will be a crucial part of the energy transition story and INTECH\u2019s services on this project will form part of a greater endeavor towards producing low cost, clean, and reliable energy.<\/p>\n<p>As a report by MarketsandMarkets notes: \u201cThe global hydrogen generation market is expected to grow from an estimated USD 160 billion in 2022 to USD 263.5 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 10.5% between 2022 to 2027\u201d. The report mentions fuel cell electric vehicles (FECV) and rockets in the aerospace industry as the primary drivers of hydrogen demand.<\/p>\n<p>In the US, the landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 is expected to generate a significant ramp up in energy transition projects. One of the aims of the law is \u201cinvesting into domestic energy production while promoting clean energy\u201d. As passed, the law represents \u201cthe largest investment into addressing climate change in US history\u201d and will authorize USD 391 billion in incentives, grants, subsidies, and tax breaks as part of the spending on energy and climate change.<\/p>\n<p>In this context, this project, while a remarkable step forward for INTECH, also represents the trust in its technologies and expertise by the industry end-users. The project itself focuses on making renewable DME from waste with negative or low Carbon intensity, which is easier to transport. A reformer pulls Hydrogen from DME, which can then be dispensed from existing filling stations and used for all Hydrogen applications.<\/p>\n<p>For the Green Hydrogen plant, INTECH is undertaking a MAC scope which includes complete electrical, ICSS, SCADA, Remote Control, access control, and communication, while also providing commissioning services for the supplied equipment. As trusted advisors for the entire solution, INTECH proposed an optimal solution design and architecture, complying with industry standard cybersecurity best practices.<\/p>\n<p>INTECH looks forward to supporting existing and new customers in future Hydrogen projects using our deep industrial automation, electrical, and digitalization expertise. The Company will continue invest significant time and resources into preparing itself for the process technologies of the future.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n<\/section>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1670930881079{margin-bottom: 10px !important;}&#8221;] INTECH\u2019s Houston HQ continues to reinforce its position as a Center of Excellence for Energy Transition projects [\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]INTECH has opened an entirely new segment for its technologies, winning a MAC scope project at a Green Hydrogen plant in California.
