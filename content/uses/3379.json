The client required construction of new Remote Instrument Enclosure (RIE) at the facility to bring the automatic system of emergency protection (SIS) and PCS in conformity with its latest standards. The segregation of PCS and SIS systems will provide required reliability and safety at the said facility.<\/p>\n<p>INTECH will provide design, engineering, fabrication, and supply of new remote instrument enclosure (RIE) with PCS, SIS\/F&amp;G, industrial grade UPS system &amp; HVAC systems, and related equipment. The existing system lacked scalability and could not be upgraded. INTECH will provide new, functionally separate systems to meet the client\u2019s objective of conforming to the latest operating and safety standards for process units.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How we are responding to COVID 19:<\/strong> We are ensuring that our services and business agreements are executed to the satisfaction of our clients and partners without exposing anyone to COVID 19.
