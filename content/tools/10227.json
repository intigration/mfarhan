This cultural shift can be attained by boosting collaboration while improving visibility to all stakeholders into a project\u2019s objectives and status. Building a DevOps culture is entirely based on collaboration and conviction though it requires people to change their old mindset at times.\r\n<p><h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Continuous Testing Role in DevOps\"><\/a><strong>Continuous Testing Role in DevOps<\/strong><\/span><\/h1><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Delivering large scale application suites can be extremely challenging. The extreme pressure of testing complex systems and meeting the demands of time-to-market make it increasingly difficult to deliver reliable systems in time.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The only potential way to meet these challenging demands of today\u2019s business environment is to start testing from the beginning of software development lifecycle. This continuous approach to testing includes testing requirements and system designs to be testable through automated techniques. <a title=\"Continuous Testing: Because DevOps and Impatient Customers matter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Continuous-Testing-Because-DevOps-and-Impatient-Customers-matter\">Continuous testing<\/a> also plays a major role in continuous delivery. It involves the usage of concepts and methods of Agile development for the QA and testing process, proposing more efficient testing process. Executing automated end-to-end testing as part of the software development continuously throughout the SDLC is termed as continuous testing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given below are a set of best practices that can help in implementing and improving testing throughout the software development lifecycle.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Continuous Testing Best Practices\"><\/a><strong>Continuous Testing Best Practices\r\n<\/strong><\/span><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1.
