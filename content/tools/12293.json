Evidently, it is crucial for enterprises to ensure seamless implementation and integration of Salesforce into the dynamics of their enterprise ecosystem.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nBut, in many of these integrations, testing is often not given preference due to either budget or time constraints or both factors in some situations. Evidently, in the absence of effective testing, it results in a poor quality product with sub-optimal performance and majorly leads to end-user or customer dissatisfaction and ends up with an overall increase in quality control costs. Hence, Salesforce integration testing should be taken up to achieve quality software.\r\n<p><\/p><p><\/p>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14103\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/salesforce-automation-testing.jpg\" alt=\"salesforce automation testing\" width=\"1250\" height=\"5500\" \/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In our yet another blog this week, we have come up with an infographic on the Benefits of Test Automation in Salesforce.
