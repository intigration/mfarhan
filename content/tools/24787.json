People are already planning for Christmas this year, the holiday shopping-inspired rush of Black Friday and Cyber Monday is approaching fast.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Millions of online shoppers look forward to visiting the eCommerce stores on Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year to shop for the latest sale items. Customers search for the best deals while expecting a fun and frictionless shopping experience. Unprepared eCommerce stores with slow or crashing applications will, however, disappoint the buyers, who will eventually move to their competitor sites.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s a no-brainer; customers will choose the sites where the shopping experience is user-friendly and frictionless.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><font size=\"5\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Some Popular Incidents of Website Crashes During Black Fridays\"><\/a><strong> Some Popular Incidents of Website Crashes During Black Fridays<\/strong><\/font><\/p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Some-Popular-Incidents-of-Website-Crashes-During-Black-Fridays.jpg\" alt=\"eCommerce Performance testing black Friday\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24802\" \/><\/center><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u2022 <\/strong>Walmart and GameStop Corp. experienced website outages, site crashes, slow load time, and other performance issues during Cyber 5.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u2022 <\/strong>Crew, the American multi-brand apparel and accessories retailer, lost $775,000 in sales and disappointed more than 323,000 shoppers in one holiday afternoon.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u2022 <\/strong>GlassesUSA, the online retailer for prescription glasses, encountered 502 Bad Gateway server problems during CyberWeek and lost hefty site traffic.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u2022 <\/strong>Costco faced losses worth $11 million as the website faced performance issues and went down for more than 16 Hrs.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><font size=\"5\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"The Real Cost of eCommerce Site Crashes on Black Friday\"><\/a><strong> The Real Cost of eCommerce Site Crashes on Black Friday<\/strong><\/font><\/p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cost-of-balck-friday-sales-crash.jpg\" alt=\"eCommerce performance testing solutions\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24803\" \/><\/center><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As seen in many reports and surveys, digital shopping is the future. It\u2019s especially true during the holiday season when deal-hungry consumers rush to the online stores and fill their shopping carts. As the holiday season approaches, eCommerce businesses are concerned about their websites experiencing crashes and other performance issues.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retailers have realized that Black Friday is no longer a single-day event. Customers seek great deals and discounts days in advance and wish them to last through the holiday season of Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Green Monday, and Christmas.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When eCommerce sites are unprepared to handle the performance and load during peak hours, they look at irreparable damage to their businesses. Apart from the heavy revenue losses businesses face during such crashes, non-performing sites also lead to irreparable loss of brand credibility and customer loyalty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"eCommerce Performance Testing for Black Friday 2023 and Beyond\"><\/a><strong> eCommerce Performance Testing for Black Friday 2023 and Beyond<\/strong><\/h1><\/p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Performance-Testing-for-Black-Friday-2022-and-Beyond.jpg\" alt=\"eCommerce Performance Testing \" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24804\" \/><\/center><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">eCommerce apps are complex platforms with multiple features like payment options, search options, cart, and product details. Each functionality should perform seamlessly to deliver the best user experience. This requires thorough eCommerce performance testing to evaluate whether the app can handle the sudden surge during the holiday season. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/performance-testing-guide\/\">Performance testing<\/a> highlights the performance-related problems with the app long before the customers do. Here is how eCommerce apps should be tested for performance and scalability.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Perform speed and load testing:<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">eCommerce businesses should consider load tests to understand the estimated load handling capacity. A robust and effective load testing strategy should ensure that the website or the mobile application handles the anticipated load without crashing. Leveraging analytics from previous years\u2019 traffic, it is recommended to estimate loads and run eCommerce performance testing accordingly. Critical user paths that should be tested include the login page, registration page, products, checkout, shopping carts, and similar pages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ensure the website is running seamlessly:<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mobile apps and web apps should be made to perform seamlessly and handle numerous transactions without any glitches. Retailers should see that their web and mobile apps are tested for both their functional and non-functional app components to ensure they deliver a great customer experience to provide seamless transactions across the value chain from adding to cart till the transaction, along with seamless gateway passage until check out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ensure safe and secure online transactions to customers:<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the rampant cyber-attacks continuing, eCommerce businesses should ensure their customers\u2019 critical data is secure and safe and that no personal transaction data is exposed to any security attack. Security testing should be taken up to ensure these web apps and mobile apps are free from cyber threats, especially during the holiday season when online transactions are at an all-time high.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ensure website accessibility:<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">eCommerce web apps should be accessible to specially-abled people. When testing for accessibility, the key areas to consider are color blindness, impaired vision, blindness, deafness, hearing impairment, motor impairment, etc. People with disabilities also want to shop online from the comfort of their homes, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Why-Accessibility-Testing-is-Important\" title=\"Why Accessibility Testing is Important\">accessibility testing<\/a> ensures they, too, have a seamless shopping experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ensure seamless customer experience (CX):<\/strong><\/h2><\/p> \r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Identify the weak points in UI\/UX and make the necessary updates to provide an intuitive interaction with the eCommerce app. eCommerce organizations should focus on the system\u2019s ease of use and streamline critical features such as easy browsing, user-friendly navigation, handy catalog, and so on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ensure usability across website features:<\/strong><\/h2><\/p> \r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Online retailers should ensure that the application is easy to use and that the users are able to find their products within a few clicks. The interface should be intuitive and not confuse users on finding the products from the list, making payments, etc. If the website\u2019s interface is hard to use, the users might be convinced to look elsewhere.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ensure mobile-readiness of apps:<\/strong><\/h2> <\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Multiple devices or platforms may be involved throughout a customer\u2019s buying journey. Customers may research their products on their smartphones and then place their orders on their iPad or other mobile devices. As a result, multi-device testing on eCommerce apps should be performed across various mobile devices, operating systems, and browsers to ensure a seamless sales transition from platform to platform.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retailers and eCommerce businesses worldwide will try to make the most out of the upcoming holiday sales.
