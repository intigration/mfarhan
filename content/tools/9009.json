Let us explore top technology trends being adopted lately.\r\n\r\n<font size=\"4\"><h1><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Top Technology Trends Transforming the Insurance Industry\"><\/a><strong>Top Technology Trends Transforming the Insurance Industry<\/strong><\/h1><\/font>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"4\"><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Cloud-based Infrastructure\"><\/a><strong>Cloud-based Infrastructure<\/strong>:<\/h2><\/font>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The insurance industry is executing a modernized workflow, which demands a considerable expansion in the use of technology and that can only be managed by means of hybrid and on-premise cloud infrastructure. The cloud-based infrastructure is guaranteeing flexibility to clients. Besides, it is also helping the insurance sector to comply with the evolving regulatory standards within the industry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"4\"><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Leveraging Big Data and Analytics\"><\/a><strong>Leveraging Big Data and Analytics <\/strong>:<\/h2><\/font>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The current application driven economy is all about data. Insurance is an industry that is data-driven which produces huge amounts of structured and unstructured data. Thus, insurance companies are relying on the Internet of Things (IOT) to gather more and more data relating to the behavior of their clients. On the other hand, Big Data and Analytics help insurers take important decisions based on the analysis of gathered data.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Gartner, Inc. forecasts that \u201c8.4 billion connected things will be in use worldwide in 2017, up 31 percent from 2016, and will reach 20.4 billion by 2020.

The advent of Artificial Intelligence in the insurance industry has made it easier for insurance agents to deliver efficient and flawless automation of existing claim processes. In the upcoming days, Artificial Intelligence will be more disruptive and will be used to evaluate and recognize emerging risks.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Gartner predicts that by 2020, AI will be a top five investment priority for more than 30 percent of CIOs.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Source: Gartner, Press Release \u201cGartner Says AI Technologies Will Be in Almost Every New Software Product by 2020\u201d July 18, 2017 <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/importance-of-software-testing-in-the-insurance-sector\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-9010\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9010\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/BB.png\" alt=\"Importance of Software Testing in Insurance Industry\" width=\"710\" height=\"230\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"4\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Automating Business Workflows\"><\/a><strong>Automating Business Workflows<\/strong>:<\/h2><\/font>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The key to moving towards a digital environment and improving customer service is to automate workflows where required. While standard direct interaction may not be so common between insurance entities, however, their relationship with the client is as important. Intrinsically, insurers need more time to interact with their clients and less time scrolling down documents and sorting papers. This is where automation of workflows helps.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To implement these technology initiatives in the existing and continuously growing technology environment, software testing is imperative.\u00a0 To be able to cope with the cumulative intricacies of systems and applications, insurance companies need a reliable testing partner.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">TestingXperts (Tx) is extensively helping global insurers in their digital transformation and helping them deliver improved customer experience and gain competitive advantage.
