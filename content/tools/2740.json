Using automated tools for certain programmable parts of the test suite can help in a faster software delivery. Test automation implemented well can ensure that the right tests are implemented at the right time to reduce overall test cycle time. Automated tests have proven to meet all kinds of customer demands.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">NEW BLOG: Ensure Continuous Delivery in Agile Testing Cycles with Test Automation <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/CYkuvV475Z\">https:\/\/t.co\/CYkuvV475Z<\/a><\/p>\r\n\u2014 TestingXperts (@TestingXperts) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TestingXperts\/status\/821633760156405762\">January 18, 2017<\/a><\/blockquote>\r\n<script src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Implementing Test Automation\"><\/a><strong>Implementing Test Automation<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enterprises are spending too much effort and costs on regression testing due to the constant changes in the environment and applications.
