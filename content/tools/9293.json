Therefore, agile methodologies are being executed in several ways. These days, agile methodology is perceived as a quick, responsive, and a flexible software development method.

All these years, testing teams have been contributing to the agile methodology and have evolved immensely.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is the list of progressions made by the testing team from several perspectives:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"4\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Benefits of Agile Methodology\"><\/a><strong>Benefits of Agile Methodology<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Great collaboration and complete involvement with the whole team:<\/strong> By shifting left in the development lifecycle give a chance to the testers to collaborate with the rest of the product team rather than just being an isolated entity that enters the phase just before the release. This value addition by the testers has revealed the evolution of their work and how they have become a great help to the other teams by collaborating with them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Better-quality work with the best methods:<\/strong> The focus on test automation has helped testers in giving up repetitive tasks from their plates which were earlier done manually. This has given testers more time to analyze and perform better and bigger things such as competitive analysis; business needs accomplishments, end-user feedback analysis, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Recognition for the work they do:<\/strong> Testing teams have their own accountability and have a better reputation than ever before. Nowadays, testers are involved in the project right from its production planning and designing stages, the development teams and the testers work together to bring out a better deliverable in lesser time. This level of contribution polish their skills and bring out their best in consideration that they were earlier not a part of.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Stronger connection with end users:<\/strong> With the understanding that in an Agile program, the product team as a whole is more accessible and involved with end users, testers as end-user representatives on the team have enormous potential to the front-end with users, be it usability studies, beta programs or product demos, etc. Currently, testers have a better understanding of the product from an end-user viewpoint which helps them get better in their own roles.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally and most importantly, agile has helped the testers to build quality with speed and contribute to the project in their own way.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/6-Most-Effective-Ways-to-Build-Business-Agility\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-9297\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/ways-to-build-business-agility.png\" alt=\"ways to build business agility\" width=\"860\" height=\"240\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14374\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/\">TestingXperts<\/a><\/strong> with its expertise and extensive experience in agile methodology has been able to deliver high-quality projects within a shorter duration.
