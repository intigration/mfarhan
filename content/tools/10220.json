Changes in the driving patterns took long enough to reflect in the premiums imposed. The arrival of telematics has changed this equation by letting insurance companies get clarity and measure the driving behavior and expand the pricing accuracy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Telematics has made sure that our car is being watched over by a spy, and it is a good thing! There has been a relief for the disciplined drivers who used to pay for other people&#8217;s errors, as auto insurance companies have deployed telematics to evaluate driver risk profiles and eventually calculate premiums on the go. Telematics is the technology that helps in sending, receiving, and storing information from road vehicles.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Telematics systems are small size systems (about the size of a mobile phone), it is kept under the dashboard of the vehicles and is used by GPS technology. They are able to monitor and transmit information such as current vehicle speed against the speed limit of the road, road conditions, the braking, cornering, and accelerating habits of the driver, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Insurance companies have access to every driver\u2019s behavior on the road, by which they can fix insurance premiums and predict expected claims. This technology can help insurers\u2019 correct irregularities in increasing pricing accuracy, risk classifications, improve profitability, reduce claim costs, fight fraudulent claims, create brand differentiators, and enable lower premiums.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For customers, usage-based insurance leads to lower premiums, providing them with value-added services such as navigation and infotainment, teen-driver monitoring, emergency services, vehicle diagnostics, and stolen vehicle recovery. Besides this, drivers can use it to establish safe driving habits to insurance companies following an accident and customers who drive at high speeds will be asked to pay high premiums. However, before the extensive adoption, proper software testing of telematics is compulsory.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"The Need and Challenges of Telematics Testing&lt;\"><\/a><strong>The Need and Challenges of Telematics Testing<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The extensive connectivity of telematics makes it essential to maintain precision and integrity in the data while transmitting it from one device to another. Usually, the in-car entertainment systems integrated with infotainment components are the ones that go under the test.
