Humans take the time to recover from infections, and still they may not be able to recover fully, therefore it is important to prevent infections. Likewise, it is as important for an organization to keep its IT systems secure rather than just relying on a robust recovery process. The best method to avoid any issue is to make security the utmost priority for your organization.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best practice to achieve this objective is to educate teams to be aware of data security best practices and trends. The technical teams should specifically focus on the new happenings and threats in the world of security and use the right set of tools to prevent various cyber attacks or threats. For example &#8211; Static Code Analyzers can help automate the process of detecting all kinds of vulnerabilities in the source code. It can further assist in identifying where open source code is used in the software using which vulnerabilities can be tracked and avoided.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Role of Security Testing\"><\/a><strong>Role of Security Testing<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Security testing ensures that all IT systems in the organization are free from all kinds of vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
