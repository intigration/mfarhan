The rise of mobile and website applications necessitate adoption of cloud. To make these applications effective and feasible, it is important to ensure their performance in all conditions of use. Performance being the utmost factor in testing a web application, it directly impacts end-user experience. Although performance testing in the cloud is quite different from the traditional approach, proper strategy and planning are involved while testing on the cloud.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main aim of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/performance-testing-guide\/\">performance testing<\/a> is to measure certain parameters such as latency, throughput with the variation in the number of parallel users accessing the application. With virtualization picking up, processes have to be made far more robust for cloud infrastructure. The real challenge comes when determining what should be moved to the cloud, and if so, whether public or private or would a hybrid be the correct choice. Would it provide value to the business? These questions make the transition to cloud all the more challenging.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Let\u2019s understand what cloud is?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cloud is a scalable pay-per-use model, where you can request for additional resources for a defined period. There is a high degree of location independence, for which virtual resources are assigned and reassigned dynamically according to the customer\u2019s need. Storage, bandwidth, processing and a number of users accessing it at any point are some of the cloud metrics that are imperative for a successful cloud implementation. Elasticity being the major factor for cloud infra defines the ability of the cloud to deal with fluctuating load variations by adding resources and decreasing when required. Other factors that define a good cloud infrastructure are availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By moving load and performance application testing to the cloud, benefits such as lowering operational and capital costs can be realized. Testing in the cloud also lets you maximize your returns by utilizing cost-effective means of scalable testing applications. It helps in stimulating load tests that constitutes millions of concurrent users from various geographies.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Types of Performance Tests on the Cloud\"><\/a><strong>Types of Performance Tests on the Cloud<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\r\nThe types of performance tests that can be performed on the cloud are:<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Load and performance tests\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Latency testing<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Capacity test<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Soak tests<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Failover tests<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Stress tests<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Browser performance testing<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The major factor pushing cloud computing is cost-effectiveness. Cloud helps in creating separate test regions for system testing with utmost ease. The test strategy should align completely with the idea of moving to the cloud, including ease of infrastructure access, costs savings, a decrease in cycle times, and choosing the types of cloud such as public, private or hybrid. The strategy should also clearly mention types of other tests to be performed in the cloud such as soak tests, capacity tests, etc. Infrastructure requirements, building a test environment, required testing tools, software, hardware, and bandwidth be the other factors that should be an important part of your test strategy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Ensure-Continuous-Delivery-in-Agile-Testing-Cycles-with-Test-Automation\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2759 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/The-Need-for-a-Perfect-Performance-Testing-Strategy-in-Cloud.jpg\" alt=\"the-need-for-a-perfect-performance-testing-strategy-in-cloud\" width=\"810\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Execution of tests is the final step that needs to be done after the entire set-up is complete. For performance tests, it is necessary to vary the load with changing user\u2019s demands and other factors so it can be tested according to a defined test strategy. It is important to make sure that all policies are clear with the Cloud services provider as usage is linked with the payment closely. Organizations are required to pay as they scale and as per the usage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Read?src=hash\">#Read<\/a> our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/blog?src=hash\">#blog<\/a> to identify the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/need?src=hash\">#need<\/a> for a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/perfect?src=hash\">#perfect<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Performance?src=hash\">#Performance<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Testing?src=hash\">#Testing<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/strategy?src=hash\">#strategy<\/a> in the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Cloud?src=hash\">#Cloud<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/7FkwB0bdCT\">https:\/\/t.co\/7FkwB0bdCT<\/a><\/p>\r\n\u2014 TestingXperts (@TestingXperts) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TestingXperts\/status\/823541465544527873\">January 23, 2017<\/a><\/blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><script src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>TestingXperts\u2019 performance testing teams have successfully conducted performance testing on the cloud for various clients.
