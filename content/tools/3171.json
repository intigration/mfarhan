In 2015, the average order value for mobile and desktop of the Black Friday sale was $127.84 in the U.S. and the total online sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday hit a record of $5.81 billion.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Black Friday is the most critical day in the e-commerce industry, leaving casualties in its wake. A huge amount of traffic can increase the revenue but, when an ecommerce site is not ready to withstand the huge increase in traffic, it can result in website crashing.\u00a0 A website crash can have a negative impact not only on the online sale but also on customer trust and damage the brand as whole. It is extremely important for the website to be resilient to sustain a huge spike traffic.<\/p>\r\nThere are less than 2 months before Black Friday so this is a perfect time for e-commerce companies to check if their website, application and infrastructure is ready for the anticipated crowd. To make sure that the website is ready, we suggest the system should be 100% performance-tuned and planned.\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"4\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Best Performance Testing Practices For Black Friday\"><\/a><strong>Here are 6 Best Performance Testing Practices For Black Friday<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Assess baseline performance:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Review current analytics to understand the current performance of the site. What are the load during current busy day and busy hour? How is performance during busy times? Are there any bottlenecks, failures, etc.? Is performance acceptable under the current volumes? Where is the traffic coming from?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Evaluate your site\u2019s performance goals from a load, stress and expected volume standpoint:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to determine whether your website can handle Black Friday\/ Cyber Monday, you need to understand what traffic to expect. How many online shoppers do we expect on a busy hour? Do we anticipate significant spikes based on time sensitive offers or steady increases in traffic? Which transaction types do we anticipate (e.g. short visits with people taking advantage of a few offers or longer visits with browsing, searching, etc.) Based on the captured numbers, analytics data and expected results, anticipated load including the expected number of concurrent users, key transaction types, and traffic spikes can be projected.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the event that projected performance load cannot be determined, we recommend planning for traffic of 3-4 times of the current load. To make sure that get optimal coverage of the site is considered from a transaction perspective, identify the 20% of online transactions that covers 80% of the total work load.\u00a0 This is usually 15-20 transactions focused on product search, shopping cart, check out, coupon codes, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Read our <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Blog?src=hash\">#Blog<\/a> &#8211; 6 Best Practices to ensure that your <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/application?src=hash\">#application<\/a> is ready for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/BlackFriday?src=hash\">#BlackFriday<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Y3jywWBhCi\">https:\/\/t.co\/Y3jywWBhCi<\/a><\/p>\r\n\u2014 TestingXperts (@TestingXperts) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TestingXperts\/status\/783595108801269760\">October 5, 2016<\/a><\/blockquote>\r\n<script src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>3. Plan all the tests:<\/strong>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nIn order to achieve your business goals, you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Need-for-a-Perfect-Performance-Testing-Strategy-in-the-Cloud\" >need to determine and plan the tests<\/a> that you need to run\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong><em>Some of the tests that we typically plan:<\/em><\/strong>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>Load Test<\/strong>:\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nIn order to understand the behavior of the system under a specific load. Execute test at current load, 75% of Black Friday load, 100%, and 150%.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>Stress Test<\/strong>:\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nFor understanding the load capacity of the system (e.g. 300% of Black Friday load)\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>Spike Test<\/strong>:\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nFor observing the system\u2019s skills hold a heavy load that was generated abruptly.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>Soak Test<\/strong>:\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nFor examining the ability of the system to hold a continuous load over a long period of time (e.g. 8 \u2013 10 hours) to identify issues such as memory leaks\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>Isolation Test<\/strong>:\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nFor running repeated test and examine whether a known system error or issue that was detected previously was fixed or not\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>4. Test to the point of Failure:<\/strong>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nAn organization must be prepared for the best and the worst-case scenario with large events such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Testing should be done to the point of failure, by running a sequence of tests while continuously increasing the load until you hit a scaling issue. This will allow the organization to know where they will have a problem in the event that marketing efforts are wildly successful.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jbf1TUF8i_0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<em>(Is your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/How-to-make-your-Application-Survive-Black-Friday-and-Cyber-Monday\" >Application Ready for Black Friday<\/a>?

Run the Tests:<\/strong>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nRun the performance tests as designed; ensuring that analytics are captured throughout all test.
