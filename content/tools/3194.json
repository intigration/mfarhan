These changes have compelled more and more enterprises to move towards the agile lifecycle model. Agile is an iterative approach to software delivery where software is built incrementally in multiple cycles rather than trying to deliver it all at once in the end. There are multiple tools available in the market to make the adoption of agile easier. \u2018HP LeanFT\u2019 is one such tool that helps in achieving this goal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"contentlist\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Contents<\/b><\/span><\/p><br>\r\n<a href=\"#What is LeanFT\">1.

Application model allows you to maintain your tests in a single location to be used across the testing suite. It comes with impressive features such as Tags, Search and Locate using object identification center that is accessible while managing large scale application models. LeanFT allows the users to use application models both in Visual Studio for your C# tests and in Eclipse for Java tests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">LeanFT offer excellent methods for verifying application behavior. LeanFT verify class, VerifyImageExists, and VerifyImageMatch methods help in checking appearance and behavior of your application. This is phenomenal as it lets you perform frontier-style verifications to check whether your application performs as you want it to.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Main advantages of HP LeanFT\"><\/a><strong>Main advantages of HP LeanFT are:<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Lower Costs \u2013 LeanFT is a plugin for IDEs like Microsoft Visual Studio and Eclipse.
