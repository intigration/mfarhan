Additionally, a new private right of action is provided to individuals who suffer losses due to the CPPA violation. Consent remains crucial, but the CPPA lifts some burden on the individual to understand and give consent by focusing more on the organization&#8217;s accountability and transparency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, If there is a new requirement for an organization to implement a privacy management policy. While planning such a policy, the organization must consider the extent and sensitivity of the personal information to be controlled.
