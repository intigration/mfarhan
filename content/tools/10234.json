Key benefits that Service Virtualization brings<\/a>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being part of a team that is following DevOps or Agile principles, delivering applications and updates as rapidly as possible becomes one of your essential tenets. Service virtualization provides teams with the option of testing different aspects of an application early, without compromising on the quality.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is Service Virtualization?\"><\/a><strong>What is Service Virtualization?<\/strong><\/h1><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Service virtualization is the process of emulating the performance of selected components within an application to enable end-to-end testing of the application. It provides testing teams with the application development and delivery ecosystem with a sequence of API test capabilities. Service virtualization can be used to create realistic simulations of needs that are not available. Service virtualization lets the teams to start testing early, more competently and continuously.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the help of service virtualization, it is easier to replace unavailable dependencies with easily configurable and accessible virtual assets. Application development teams can use these virtual services to conduct integration testing earlier in the development process. Virtualized test assets appear and act real but can be duplicated and made available at times during the unavailability of real assets with the testing team. Virtualizing the test assets can enable your organization to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/test-automation-frameworks\" title=\"Test Automation Frameworks \u2013 Why, Types, Benefits, Approach\">robust test frameworks<\/a> that can provide comprehensive test coverage while keeping the costs low.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Importance of creating Virtual Service Environments (VSEs) for the test environments\"><\/a><strong>Importance of creating Virtual Service Environments (VSEs) for the test environments<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To reach the ultimate goal of testing enterprise applications, organizations must build their own test environments by manually replicating the components they need to interact with. Traditional testing tools do not have the proper functionality to test these applications on a collaborative basis thoroughly. Virtual Service Environments provide multiple teams to have a realistic technique to simulate the test of an application. Virtual environments also help in reducing the hardware and installation costs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Challenges faced by virtual test environment\"><\/a><strong>Challenges faced by virtual test environment<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Challenges offered by constrained access to dependencies during the development and testing becomes stronger when organizations move towards continuous delivery. The absence of suitable test environments for your dependencies can become a huge barrier when you want to build, test and deploy your software on demand without any help from real testers. Some of the key challenges faced by virtual test environments are listed below:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Significant Increase in Testing cost<\/p>\r\n<p>\u2022 Unstable and Late Delivery of environment<\/p>\r\n<p>\u2022 Lack of Consistency<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Considering virtual test environments as objects in your CI\/ CD pipeline\"><\/a><strong>Considering virtual test environments as objects in your CI\/ CD pipeline<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a huge step to run your virtual test environments at some server in your network. However, service virtualization is the next step, as it serves as an enabler for continuous delivery. In this process, virtual assets are considered as artifacts that can be created, used, and destroyed at your convenience.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most effective way to treat your test environments as continuous delivery objects is by containerizing them. Containerizing can be done by using various platforms, for example, Docker. With the help of these platforms, you can create an image that contains your service virtualization engine, data sources that contain the necessary test data, and all virtual assets to emulate the required behavior.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Advantages of containerized test environments\"><\/a><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>Advantages of containerized test environments<\/strong><\/span><\/h5><p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are several compelling advantages for development and testing activities that can be brought by containerized test environments in your continuous delivery process:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Test environments can be rolled on demand, so there is no need for waiting up until that dependency you need is accessible and configured like you want it to be.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u2022 There is zero need for you to worry about resetting the test environment to its original state after testing is completed. You need to throw the test environment away and spin up a new instance ready for your next test run.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u2022 Having the virtual test environment at your service every time makes it easier to analyze and reproduce bugs.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Ensure-Continuous-Delivery-in-Agile-Testing-Cycles-with-Test-Automation\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3164\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3164\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Also-read-Agile-1.png\" alt=\"also-read\" width=\"710\" height=\"230\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<h5><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Key benefits that Service Virtualization brings\"><\/a><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>Key benefits that Service Virtualization brings<\/strong><\/span><\/h5><p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>\u2022 Rapidly creates situations and patterns that emulate the expected activities<\/strong>\r\n<\/em>There are various instances where glitches are felt while working on connected components within a system.
