It is based on the idea that banks should extend their customer experience abilities by integrating services and products offered by third-party providers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Open banking makes noise in the fintech industry by uplifting financial services, let\u2019s discuss Open banking and its impact on the financial landscape.<\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is Open Banking?\"><\/a><strong> What is Open Banking?<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-23518\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/What-is-Open-Banking.jpg\" alt=\"Open Banking API\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" \/><\/center><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Open Banking refers to banks\u2019 extended capability to securely share customers\u2019 financial data with third-party providers via APIs. Open banking aims to elevate the customer experience by giving them more choices and governance over their finances.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It can be said that open banking is an open data model wherein customer data, with their consent, is shared with different stakeholders across the banking environment. Third-party providers have access to this data in the form of transactions, fund checks, commencement of credit transfers, and so on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How is open banking reshaping the financial landscape?\"><\/a><strong> How is open banking reshaping the financial landscape?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-23519\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/How-is-Open-Banking-Reshaping-The-Financial-Landscape.jpg\" alt=\"Open banking API fintech\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" \/><\/center>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earlier, consumers had access only to the products and services offered by the banks. With open banking, consumers can tap into a diverse range of products and services provided by different banks and financial institutions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since open banking allows sharing customer data with third-party providers, these providers can proactively develop and launch new and customized products and services that cater to the specific needs of consumers. As a result, consumers get a more personalized experience tailored to their individual needs.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The benefits of open banking continue beyond the consumers. Financial institutions also leverage open banking to access the latest range of financial products and services that may grow their business and help them strive in the competitive market. Along with accessing third-party products and services, consumer data can be utilized to create new products and services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What are Open Banking APIs?\"><\/a><strong> What are Open Banking APIs? <\/strong><\/h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Open banking APIs are the bridge that moves consumer data from a bank\u2019s database to the service providers. This allows the bank to offer a comprehensive range of services, payment plans, and financial products tailored to each customer. Banks can develop their own unique APIs, linking them to external APIs to create a customer-centric financial ecosystem.<\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How are Open Banking APIs reshaping the banking experience for customers?\"><\/a><strong> How are Open Banking APIs reshaping the banking experience for customers?<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-23530\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/How-are-Open-Banking-APIs-Reshaping-Banking-Experience-for-customers-05-min.jpg\" alt=\"how open banking api works\" width=\"705\" height=\"346\" \/><\/center><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Smarter customer onboarding:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Knowing your customer is always important, but in some industries, verifying accounts and identities is essential to doing business. Open banking APIs let companies check the authenticity of customers&#8217; information. This accelerates KYC processes and cuts down process complexity and cost.<\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Better understanding of customers\u2019 needs:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A personalized customer experience is a great customer experience. Data APIs give more information about users\u2019 finances and habits, allowing finance product companies to offer tailored services.<\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Lower fees:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Processing payments can be a pricey proposition, but open banking takes cost out of the equation for merchants. Payment APIs lack both the transaction fees and operational costs of other methods. Businesses can <strong>save up to 80% on fees<\/strong> compared to cards.<\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Faster settlement:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Waiting for funds to settle is an inconvenience many businesses hope to avoid. While cards and Direct Debit payments can take days for funds to settle, open banking APIs facilitate instant processing and settlement, ensuring that companies receive their money when needed.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evidently, for open banking APIs to deliver acclaimed benefits to customers and financial institutions, effective API testing is required for end-to-end testing of open banking APIs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Why is API testing critical for Open Banking apps?\"><\/a><strong> Why is API testing critical for Open Banking apps?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-23521\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Why-is-API-testing-critical-for-Open-Banking-Apps.jpg\" alt=\"Open Banking API testing\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" \/><\/center>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to open API testing, banks must guarantee that integrations are completed and tested as thoroughly as possible. Banks will primarily need to validate API queries\u2019 data response and behavior during API testing. Financial institutions will necessitate the design and testing of APIs that are aligned with essential business logic and procedures. Banks can automate most API testing, including <a title=\"Functional Testing \u2013 An Informative Guide for Beginners\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/functional-testing\">functional testing<\/a>, data validation, and regression testing.
