However, this has turned out to be a corporate disaster for Samsung. The Galaxy Note 7 was expected to be star device that would have lead the company\u2019s sales during the upcoming holiday season. This device was expected to compete and stand up to the iPhone 7 in comparison tests. \r\n\r\nThe Galaxy Note 7 is not the only gadget to catch fire all thanks to the lithium battery, which have distressed gadgets from iPhones to cars like Tesla. If anything is to be blamed, it\u2019s chemistry as the batteries that we rely on everyday life is prone to leaking and causing damage if exposed to excessive heat.
