However, there is a dire need for technology startups to follow the same. Technology startups often face uncertainties and funding roadblocks. However, there is a great reason for startups to opt Software Testing; and the reason is <strong>Quality<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"contentlist\"><b><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Contents<\/span><\/b>\r\n<a href=\"#Limitations of a Technology Startup\">1.

In fact, <strong>IBM<\/strong> states\u00a0that the cost of errors increases dramatically as your software solution progresses through the development cycle. It\u2019s about 30 times more expensive to fix a bug after release than during the initial stages.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-10025 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/cost_of_software_bugs_according_to_ibm.png\" alt=\"Cost of errors in Software testing &amp; QA \" width=\"1007\" height=\"346\" \/>[Image Source \u2013 IBM]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h1><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Limitations of a Technology Startup\"><\/a><strong>Limitations of a Technology Startup<\/strong><\/h1><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just like any other enterprise, technology startups have their limitations and challenges in software testing. These include lack of budgets, time and resources that have to be allocated to testing. Let us discuss these challenges in detail.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Time:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a constant pressure for startups to release a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) fast to get quick returns. Most startups perceive releasing their product in the market and fixing the bugs later upon identified by users\/market is a good idea. However, they fail to realize that post-production testing takes a lot of time as there is a need to rework on the same piece of code every time they make a change. Hence, more time is involved in finding and correcting bugs at this stage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Resources:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like every coin has two sides, startups also come with the excitement of learning something new and dealing with the constant pressure of wearing multiple hats. Most startups don\u2019t have a dedicated department for testing, their development teams perform the necessary tests. Therefore, they might overlook some bugs due to the lack of dedicated resources for testing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Budget:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Budget constraints are a harsh reality for startups, and this is the reason software testing is overlooked. Additional headcount means extra expenses. The cost associated with finding bugs posts the production stage is way higher than finding them during the development stage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Thought Leadership:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Often, technology startups lack a Thought Leadership team having a strategic planning of QA activities. The tools to use, the number of resources to involve, the total amount of time QA activities consume and the overall costs are often overlooked by startups. This makes it difficult for technology startups to release a certain application.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Understanding how to overcome the above limitations can help technology startups define their strategy. Under no circumstances should software testing be overlooked or dismissed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Major Goals and Objectives of Software Testing\"><\/a><strong>Major Goals and Objectives of Software Testing<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; Finding defects in the software to allow a smooth process<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Evaluating the level of a product\u2019s quality and informing the stakeholder<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Ensuring that the final results match business specifications and user requirements<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Increasing profit potential<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Gaining customer loyalty by offering a quality product<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Software\u00a0Testing Types\u00a0 that Shouldn\u2019t Be Ignored\"><\/a><strong>Software\u00a0Testing Types\u00a0 that Shouldn\u2019t Be Ignored<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Here are a few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/types-of-software-testing\">types of software testing<\/a> that should never be ignored:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Exploratory Testing<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a new application, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Exploratory-Testing-Why-is-it-Beneficial-for-your-Application\">exploratory testing<\/a> is exceptionally important to lay the foundation of quality.
