Protecting internal and private data is a concern for every country and organization. Every country or region is coming up with its own Data Protection Act to protect their data from cyber-attacks and other probing vulnerabilities. Likewise, On April 14, 2016, the European Union parliament approved the General Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as GDPR. The law will be enforced from May 25, 2018. GDPR will be directly applicable in each EU Member State.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"contentlist\"><strong>Contents<\/strong>\r\n<a href=\"#How Can your Organization Adapt to the GDPR Compliance?\">1.

Though many organizations have implemented processes steady with GDPR, this new Regulation will affect most organizations on various levels. Failing to meet the terms with the GDPR can lead to a fine of up to 4% of the global turnover or \u20ac20,000,000, whichever is higher. Hence, companies have become more cautious to adapt to this changing data protection law and are hiring expensive consultants to secure their data by the deadline.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How Can your Organization Adapt to the GDPR Compliance?\"><\/a><strong>How Can your Organization Adapt to the GDPR Compliance?<\/strong><\/h1><\/font><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adherence to the regulation will require a comprehensive security approach, with assistance from legal and IT departments.
