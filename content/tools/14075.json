Conclusion<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Enterprises are in need of quality products in today\u2019s fast-paced world. Software quality assurance is the key process to ensure quality products. Wikipedia defines Software Quality Assurance (SQA) as a \u201cMeans of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure quality.\u201d SQA typically encompasses the entire software development life cycle (SDLC) which includes requirements gathering, design, coding, software testing, release management, and the final product launch.<\/p> \r\n<p>Software testing being a part of the Quality Assurance (QA) has become an important step during the SDLC. This software testing is a significant gatekeeper for businesses to determine when the code could move into the final steps of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/uat-testing\">user acceptance testing<\/a> (UAT)and further to production.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This QA ensures that the developed software meets and complies with the standard set of quality specifications for a given product. This sort of QA testing deals with testing the software to identify bugs or defects if any, and ensures a quality product is delivered to end-users. The QA function ensures that the product meets the requirements and ascertains the product quality is achieved.In the earlier waterfall model, the QA testing was taken up at the end of the SDLC which led to deferred project timelines, and at times, even the quality was not properly achieved.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The QA team was more involved only in the identification of errors and bugs and retesting them to ensure a quality product is launched. Earlier, even the products were not so complex and QA testing could handle the requirements specifications and test the product.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, in recent times, the products and applications are complex in their outlook and needed much more effort from the QA teams to ensure faster releases and at the same time maintaining software quality. Thus, there emerged a need to transform from Quality Assurance to Quality Engineering.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Why Quality Engineering?\"><\/a><strong>Why Quality Engineering?<\/strong><\/h1>\r\n\r\n<center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14181\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Quality-Assurance-QA-to-Quality-Engineering-QE.png\" alt=\"Quality Assurance (QA) to Quality Engineering (QE)\" width=\"401\" height=\"401\" \/><\/center>\r\n<p>In recent times, the process of software development has moved towards agile and DevOps processes as businesses are in need for faster releases to get to market faster. Evidently, with agile and DevOps processes on the go, the software testing process has taken a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Why-is-shifting-left-the-right-thing-to-do-in-QA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shift-left approach<\/a> wherein the testing is done parallel to software development to ensure faster identification of bugs and quality releases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The QA in the agile process tests the entire system based on the sprints to cater to software features development.The QA teams take up software testing along with the development process, from the initial stages of DevOps process to ensure continuous integration(CI) and continuous delivery(CD) to ensure faster releases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DevOps CI\/CD and agile development processes have changed the world of quality assurance. The QA teams have less planning time due to continuous releases during sprints and hence they struggle to accomplish <a title=\"Regression Testing Guide \u2013 Tools, Types and Techniques\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/regression-testing\">regression testing<\/a> on time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the QA teams are required to think more creatively and realistically than ever before. Thus, the QA has taken a shift from Quality Assurance to Quality engineering, to ensure faster releases enforced with DevOps CI\/CD and agile processes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<b>Software quality engineering (SQE)<\/b> assures high standards during a software development process and specifically holds good for <a title=\"Agile Vs DevOps Methodologies \u2013 A Detailed Comparison\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/agile-vs-devops-methodologies\">agile and DevOps methodologies<\/a>.

Further, this transformation has also led to a new role of SDET (Software Developer in Test) responsible to build test infrastructure, identify test scope, and define quality criteria. These SDET\u2019s start with unit testing and extend to all other tests and should even build a mitigation strategy in case the situation demands.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are responsible to manage and maintain CI\/CD pipelines to ensure the code keeps moving through the pipeline.
