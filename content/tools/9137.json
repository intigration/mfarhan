However, to skillfully segregate complex, monolithic applications into independent units, a design strategy namely \u201c<em>Microservices\u201d<\/em> is essential.<\/p>\r\n<font size=\"5\"><h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What are Microservices?\"><\/a><strong>What are Microservices?<\/strong><\/h1><\/font>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Monolithic applications were once effective in the digital economy, but not anymore. Development teams across enterprises have been struggling hard to deal with large applications pertaining to deployment, development time, and scalability. With the extensive adoption of DevOps frameworks and agile methodologies, development teams felt the necessity to break down complex application silos into simpler code blocks, which enlightens microservices.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Microservices has successfully made its mark in the software architecture market. The Microservices architecture differs from the traditional monolithic architecture where the application was built as a single entity. However the monolithic architecture is rather sound, obstructions around it are building precisely when almost all applications are being deployed on the cloud platform. Microservices architecture constitutes an integrated skelton where rather than plugging the components together, the software is fragmented by breaking it down into services.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By fragmenting a big application into microservices, development teams become more active with updates and deployments. Whereas, it also removes dependencies to create complex and large builds, by eliminating the need for over-sophisticated architectures.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"5\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How can an enterprise benefit from microservices?\"><\/a><strong>How can an enterprise benefit from microservices?<\/strong><\/h2><\/font>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every enterprise has different needs; there can be times when microservices would be a good solution and, times when a monolithic application would make more sense.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For enterprises on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Accelerate-Digital-Transformation-by-Reinventing-Testing\" >digital transformation<\/a> journey, with the need to be agile, implementing a microservices architecture has several advantages in the app economy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Easier to scale: In the microservices architecture, only the components that need improved scalability are affected, than the entire app. This also provides substantial cost savings to the enterprise.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. A Grander architecture for larger applications: In this architecture, components can be built or swapped at will without having an impact on the entire application. In this case, if something goes wrong, only that component is affected.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Agility is the key: Microservices architecture provides more agility and makes it easier to pivot segments of an application.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, microservices based applications also have:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Trouble <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/services\/api-web-services-testing\/\" >testing the entire API app<\/a> but becomes far easier to test individual components.\r\n2. Extra moving parts than a monolithic app, which becomes difficult to monitor.\r\n3. Extra modern back-end infrastructure requirements to the growing codebase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"5\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Testing Microservices\"><\/a><strong>Testing Microservices<\/strong><\/h2><\/font>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evidently, the testing strategy that is applied to the traditional monolithic application needs to change with the shift to microservices. Considering that applications that are built in the microservices architecture offer high performance and functionality, testing has to cover each layer of the service. A microservices architecture comprises of small, focused services that create a whole application together. Each illustration of a microservices represents a distinct responsibility within the application. The actual advantage is these services are independent of each other, which makes them independently testable. However, due to the disseminated environment of microservices development, testing can often become a challenge. Some of the challenges are given below:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Accessibility of a dedicated test environment since development is agile and not integrated.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u2022 Recognizing the right amount of testing each time in the test lifecycle<\/p>\r\n<p>\u2022 Complex extraction logs during testing and data<\/a> validation<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Containerization-Accelerate-DevOps-Adoption-using-Containers\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-9142\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9142\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/P.png\" alt=\"Agility and Reliability in software testing Improve Software Testing and Devops with Containerization\" width=\"860\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Today\u2019s DevOps and Agile-focused enterprises are endeavoring for fast changes and quick deployments.
