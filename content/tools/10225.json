The idea of being hacked and being driven to bankruptcy has always haunted small and medium enterprises. There has been a persistent need for robust security testing and to bring a change in the world of security.\u00a0 Gartner has coined a very interesting name keeping in mind the criticality of Application Security aspect in DevOps implementation \u2013 \u201cDevSecOps\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>According to a report from Gartner on \u201cInformation security architects must integrate security at multiple points into DevOps workflows in a collaborative way that is largely transparent to developers, and preserves the teamwork, agility, and speed of DevOps and agile development environments, delivering &#8220;DevSecOps.&#8221;\u201d (*)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is DevSecOps?\"><\/a><strong>What is DevSecOps?<\/strong><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gartner\u2019s new concept of \u201cDevSecOps,\u201d which is a merger of DevOps and security aims in bringing the mindset and culture of DevOps into security testing practices. The DevOps mindset displays that security is everybody\u2019s responsibility. The scarce supply of security skill sets to embed in the value creation process has caused a significant slowdown in business outcomes.<\/p>\r\n\r\nWith the growing business demand for Agile, DevOps, and Public Cloud Services, traditional security testing processes have become a major obstruction. Once a system has been designed, its security defects can be identified by security test teams subsequently and corrected by business operators before its actual release. The process designed this way can only work where the pace of business activities is a waterfall, but with DevOps in tow, it seldom works. However, with the introduction of DevSecOps risk reduction can in no way be abandoned by either the security staff or the business operators. Instead, it should be embraced and improved by everyone within the organization. Everyone having a responsibility of being an essential part of this process can contribute with the appropriate knowledge and skills they have.\r\n\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Importance of DevSecOps\"><\/a><strong>Importance of DevSecOps<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Recent Gartner research indicates that 38% of enterprises are now using DevOps, and 50% will be actively using it by the end of 2016.
