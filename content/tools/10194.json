Many software companies have improvised their test automation efforts through data-driven approach\/testing, also called as keyword-driven test automation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h1><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is Keyword-Driven Testing?\"><\/a><strong>What is Keyword-Driven Testing?<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keyword-driven testing is a software testing methodology, suitable for both automated or manual testing. It uses a set of keywords or action words to define individual test cases or test actions. For instance, actions like login, click, enter client name and more are pre-defined within the test code using keywords \u2013 \u201ccommands\u201d. These keywords can be used multiple times within the same <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Ensure-Software-Quality-by-Achieving-Maximum-Test-Coverage\" >test case to maximize test coverage<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keyword-based testing provides a great level of abstraction that allows testers both experienced and inexperienced, to manage testing in more compatible and versatile ways. The testers use keywords to identify objects and parts of their test scripts. The intention of this <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/types-of-software-testing\" title=\"type of testing\">type of testing<\/a> is to make even the less-savvy users to test using keywords without having to write instructions in conventional coding languages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How Keyword-Driven Testing Works?\"><\/a><strong>How Keyword-Driven Testing Works?<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keyword-driven testing is a sequence of operations, recorded in a keyword format.
