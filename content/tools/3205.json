Amidst this change, time-to-market, cost, and customer experience are the three constants that are topping the corporate stakeholder agenda. Though their priority order keeps on changing over time, customer experience holds the top most priority these days. These changes in priority and focus are now gradually but certainly rippling into quality assurance (QA). Traditionally, QA was meant to just validate the functionality of the software, hardware or networking components, with no receptiveness to the customer experience. However, in this modern phase, customer experience represents the brand, the company and resources inside it.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"contentlist\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Contents<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#Digital Assurance Solutions\">1.

To expand the digital business agenda, QA organizations are breaking loose from their traditional bug testing shackles and embracing frictionless, full-lifecycle automation and a continuous delivery approach. A continuous delivery approach ensures quality from the beginning, enabling delivery of enhanced customer experiences.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another change in QA is that though it has always focused on value delivery, the intention has shifted to accelerated time-to-value. This new attitude portrays that if it is done right first time, there is no need to validate. Emerging methodologies and technologies have presented both challenges and opportunities to this objective; hence, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/how-crucial-is-devops-for-digital-assurance-testing\">digital assurance testing<\/a> strategy is essential to the QA function.
