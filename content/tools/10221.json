During this approach, acceptance tests describe the project&#8217;s accomplishment and successfully drive the development.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Continuous testing right from the development phase and throughout the phase helps in locating, identifying, and fixing the flaws arising at each level of the development lifecycle. Shift left approach helps in identifying and addressing defects very early in the lifecycle. The early introduction of the testing process offers flexibility to the developers to apply dynamic changes throughout the development phase. This approach helps in preventing defects rather than facing unexpected defects at a later stage. Therefore, shift left approach is considered to be the economical way of reducing the time, effort, and cost of fixing the defects at a much later stage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is Shift right testing approach\"><\/a><strong>Shift right testing approach<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While shift left testing approach helps in delivering software that adheres to quality attributes as specified by the business, it may sometimes lack in providing the proper performance and functioning in a real-world environment. This is where shift right testing approach comes into the picture. It helps initiate the testing task from the right, which means the post-production of the software.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this approach, feedback is gathered from targeted users to experience satisfaction in managing and using the software in real-world conditions, thereby improving the quality. Shift right process helps in getting continuous feedback from users, which is quite significant in the testing process. It helps respond better to unexpected circumstances such as crashes, slow performance, failure, and many other things.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Advantages of adopting shift-left and shift-right approach\"><\/a><strong>Advantages of adopting shift-left and shift-right approach:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\u2022 Time and effort can be saved immensely\r\n\r\n\u2022 Bugs are detected and fixed early\r\n\r\n\u2022 Promotes cost-effectiveness\r\n\r\n\u2022 High test coverage\r\n\r\n\u2022 Promotes teamwork within the tester and developer community\r\n\r\n\u2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Accelerate-Software-Delivery-with-DevOps-Best-Practices\">Accelerates software delivery<\/a>\r\n\r\n\u2022 Quality software in production\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A proper test strategy should be created to incorporate techniques of shifting left and right, thereby making the process better, faster, and steadier for continuous delivery.<\/p>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Telematics-Driving-Usage-Based-Auto-Insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2869 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Also-read-Telematics.png\" alt=\"Blog: Telematics Testing\" width=\"710\" height=\"230\" \/><\/a>\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Continuous testing\"><\/a><strong>Continuous testing<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is the process of executing <a title=\"Automated Testing: Challenges worth Accepting and Testing\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Automated-Testing-Challenge-worth-Accepting-and-Testing\">automated tests<\/a> as part of the software delivery pipeline to gain instant response on the business risks regarding the software release.
