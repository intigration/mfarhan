Initially, it was commonly known as QTP (Quick Test Professional). UFT or the QTP is the automated functional testing tool developed by Micro Focus. In this tool, automated test cases are used to identify bugs in an application; also, it is primarily used for testing on service, functional and regression. With a planned automation testing practice using UFT, a tester can enhance the application development and reduce the cost and time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest version of this tool is HP UFT 11.5; and it supports several languages and platforms such as SAP, Oracle, Web, .Net, web services, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>Features of UFT<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n<p><li>This tool can support for Windows 8.1 and Windows server 2012; run tests on safari browser<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li>This tool supports latest technologies such as XenDesktop 7, JDK 1.8, and SAP Web Dynpro ABAP<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> This tool supports to record, run tests and create object repositories with Windows Runtime Application<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> The UFT extension which is available on Chrome can receive updates automatically<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> This tool can be used by both technical and non-technical testers<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li>The testing is completely based on scripting language VB script<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li>This tool enables to test the cases of both desktop and web applications<\/li><\/p>\r\n<\/ul><\/p>\r\n<p><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -50px;\" name=\"What is Selenium?\"><\/a><strong>What is Selenium?<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/selenium-testing\">Selenium is an open-source test automation tool<\/a> for testing web applications across different browsers and platforms. There are many such tools available but this tool is becoming a choice for many enterprises because of its speed and efficiency. This allows the tester to use multiple programming languages like C#, Python, Java, etc. for creating Selenium test scripts.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>Features of Selenium <\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>This tool is an open-source and portable web testing framework<\/p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n<p><li> It is simple to understand and easy to use interface<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li>This tool supports different browsers, operating systems, and programming languages<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li>It can get integrated with frameworks like Ant and Maven for source code compilation<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> Selenium Remote Control, which is in conjunction with WebDriver API known as Selenium 2.0 supports vibrant web pages and Ajax<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li>It can get integrated with automation testing frameworks like TestNG to generate reports and application testing<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> The different commands that are categorized in different classes make any user easily understand and implement<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> This tool supports parallel execution and thus enhances the efficiency of the tests and decreases the testing time<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> Compared to other automation tools, selenium requires less amount of resources<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> The playback and record feature of Selenium IDE helps to authorize tests without the requirement of learning test scripting languages<\/li><\/p>\r\n<p><li> There is no need for server installation for the web driver.

However, Selenium seems to be quickly gaining supporters and becoming a more proficient open source entrant for digital applications. There are various visible distinctions between every testing tool that makes picking one or the other a forthright decision in most cases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -50px;\" name=\"Difference between UFT and Selenium\"><\/a><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong>Difference between UFT and Selenium<\/strong><\/span><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><\/strong><\/span><strong>Testing Applicability<\/strong>:<\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Selenium is mainly for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/5-best-practices-for-web-application-testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">testing web-based applications<\/a> whereas UFT(HP Unified Functional Testing) can test desktop and client-server applications as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cost<\/strong>:<\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Selenium is a totally free open source download and will always remain like this whereas, UFT requires a license fee for procurement and additional fees for add-ons and upgrades.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>OS Compatibility<\/strong>:<\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">UFT works only on windows whereas selenium works on all major OSs including Linux, OSX, Windows, Android, Solaris and, iOS.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Language Compatibility<\/strong>:<\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Selenium tests can be written in languages such as JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Java whereas UFT tests are only written in Microsoft\u2019s VB Script.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cloud Ready<\/strong>:<\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Selenium grid is precisely designed to run simultaneous tests on different machines with different operating systems and using different browsers in parallel making it a perfect match for cloud-based testing services. Whereas, UFT has a one machine\/ one-script execution model which cannot make an efficient use of distributed test execution with cloud infrastructure.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3><strong>Object-Repository:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>There is an in-built object repository in HP-UFT, whereas there is no object-repository in Selenium. But, the object is managed with the help of UI element user extension.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ease of Execution<\/strong>:<\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Selenium can execute multiple tests simultaneously on a single machine whereas UFT tests one application per machine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3><strong>Active User Community:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>Selenium is having an active user community, but it doesn\u2019t have a dedicated team to support the users; whereas the UFT tool provides the facility of dedicated technical team to support the users.
