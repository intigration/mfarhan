In particular, with user experience, every brand is building strategies to ensure better customer experience. Considering the focus that is on strengthening their digital impact, every brand\/service\/product is striving to come up with appealing website designs and mobile-based applications.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those winning brands in the wearable tech ecosystem recognize the importance of customer experience for the growth of their product. Every day, there is a new competition in the wearables space. From watches to glasses, different challenges are involved with every technology. However, the main challenge faced by the wearables industry is to ensure the best user experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Why is Usability Testing Critical?\"><\/a><strong>Why is Usability Testing Critical?<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Usability Testing identifies crucial usability issues before the product is launched.

Easy access to information<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wearables gather information such as the number of steps taken, miles covered, track heartbeat of a user and more. Usability Testing ensures the data captured by these devices is easily accessible and displayed to users clearly.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Ease of use<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wearable devices provide ease to people who want to track their movements. If the device is not easily accessible and is complex, it is obvious that its market would be limited after receiving initial feedback from the users. The device should be easy to use and should be aesthetically attractive. Usability Testing considers various aspects to check if the device is user-friendly and is appealing to the customers or not. Some aspects are:<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Screen Size<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Font Size<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Colors Used<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Touch Panel<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8211; Easy Scroll<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Gesture and voice feedback<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wearables are on the users\u2019 body constantly, and people move in unanticipated ways. What happens when a hello wave interrupts tracking or switches a smart device from ambient to interactive mode? Device input discrepancies could be the make it or break it for a user. This is where Usability Testing comes into the picture as it checks the device for any struggle while registering the different tones of voice.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Call interruption and notifications<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As wearables sync to mobile devices, but do not necessarily have all the functions of a mobile, disturbances like notifications and calls can interrupt or even ruin the user. Helped by Interrupt Testing (a part of usability testing), it can be validated that the calls or notifications do not interrupt the functioning of the device.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Connectivity issues<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most wearables connect to the phone via Bluetooth, which makes Bluetooth connectivity the most important thing to test as connectivity issues can annoy even the techiest of users. Usability Testing ensures that setting up wearable device connectivity with mobile is easy and doable without toiling much.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Feedback from user groups<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Usability testing involves real-time usage of the device to get candid feedback of the users. It is essential to discover defects and errors that are unknown and can arise when a user is using the device.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/usability-testing-the-key-to-a-flawless-user-experience-infographic\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-9963\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9963\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/C-3.jpg\" alt=\"Website Usability Testing Services Infographic\" width=\"849\" height=\"173\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wearable technology market is emerging, and the demand is likely to rise in future. Therefore, to attract more consumers, smart technology is required. However, the interface being offered should be easy to use. To deliver a consistent, seamless and high-quality experience for users, wearables should be thoroughly tested.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To ensure Quality is no more a concern, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/How-Outsourcing-QA-Can-Be-a-Game-Changer-for-Your-Business\">outsourcing QA<\/a> <\/strong>to a third-party organization with the right expertise can be your best choice.
