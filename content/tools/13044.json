Conclusion<\/a><\/p>\r\n<h1><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is IR35?\"><\/a><strong>What is IR35?<\/strong><\/h1>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nIR35 in simple words is legislation in the UK introduced by HMRC (Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs) in the year 2000 wherein UK contractors were entitled to pay the same tax and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) on par with an equivalent employee.\r\n\r\nIR35 is a set of tax laws that effectively forms a part of the Finance Act and is more commonly referred to as an Intermediaries Legislation.\r\n\r\nThe new changes to this <strong><em>IR35 (Off Payroll Working Rules)<\/em><\/strong> will come into existence from <strong>6<sup>th<\/sup> of April 2020<\/strong> and it is the responsibility of the limited company to decide on their own the employment status of each assignment.\r\n\r\nWith the new IR35 legislation coming into effect in UK this year, it essentially aims to close a loophole in the tax system where workers use a limited company structure to pay less tax.\r\n\r\nWith IR35, responsibility for taxation would shift to the company\/employer rather than the individuals or contractors. In a way, this legislation entails restricting contractors from avoiding payment of taxes and NIC that should be paid as part of the employment.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How does IR35 affect different companies and other sectors?\"><\/a><strong>How does IR35 affect different companies and other sectors?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nA report by Brookson Legal has warned that Private sector firms need to take their time to understand the complexities of the incoming IR35 tax avoidance reforms or risk losing their contractor talent.\r\n\r\nThese new IR35 reforms are a major threat for private sector firms with the liability carried by the fee-paying party which is the major threat of all.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2020, as the IR35 rules will change, majorly it will affect the medium and large businesses within private sector. Companies will be responsible for determining the employment status for the tax of the workers whom they engage via an intermediary.\r\n\r\nFor self-employed individuals working for a limited company for just one client in a role that has equal risk, will have to introspect whether they are inside IR35 or outside IR35.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is the Bigger Picture of IR35?\"><\/a><strong>What is the Bigger Picture of IR35?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nIR35 is truly not the end of contracting but its avoidance is not possible as with the new legislation rules, hirers may take a decision to cease the hire of PSC contractors or disguised employment.\r\n\r\nUnder this disguised employment, earlier people would work for firms and organizations as contractors using certain intermediaries such as limited companies. Earlier, they could slash the tax bills for both the employee and the employer.\r\n\r\nHMRC says that\u00a0when\u00a0determining\u00a0whether IR35 applies\u00a0to a contract or engagement, \u201cyou must work out the employment status of the person providing their services.\u201d HMRC goes on to say that the off-payroll rules\u00a0apply if\u00a0the contractor \u201cwould be an employee\u00a0if\u00a0there was no intermediary.\u201d\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How to be Prepared for New IR35 Rules?\"><\/a><strong>How to be Prepared for New IR35 Rules?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nNow, it is the time to pull up your socks as April 2020 is fast approaching and companies with contract workers will have to plan on how to proceed with this complicated tax reform.\r\n\r\nThere would be a possible end for contractors working as \u2018disguised employees\u2019. The medium and large private sector firms would become responsible for deciding whether a contractor provides a service as self-employed or as an employee.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, many business sectors depend on contracting and it is no surprise that this upcoming IR35 legislation poses a high risk for companies if not addressed in time.\r\n\r\nIR35 amendments would compel companies to switch to PAYE model rather than using contractors.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How TestingXperts can help Companies with Managed IR35 Services?\"><\/a><strong>How TestingXperts can help Companies with Managed IR35 Services?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14364\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/IR35-Legislation-1.jpg\" alt=\"IR35-Legislation\" width=\"848\" height=\"454\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<strong>To address the potential issue of losing critical Contractor skills, Tx has various offerings:<\/strong>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>&#8211; Skill-based outsourcing:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nAll QA, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/services\/devops-agile-testing\/\">testing and DevOps<\/a> skills made available across a variety of location models (Onsite, Offsite and Offshore).
