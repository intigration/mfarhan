These machines are programmed to perform test cases without manual intervention. Robot-led test automation has various benefits such as faster test execution, higher testing accuracy, accurate reporting, lesser maintenance, etc. By leveraging bot-led test automation businesses can ensure faster time-to-market, higher operational efficiency and a significant reduction in costs.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Today most enterprises are moving towards digital transformation to beat the competition. Businesses should leverage the latest technologies to make their enterprise digitally transformed. This digital transformation revolves around their technology &amp; IT landscape, new process adoptions, and also needs application modernization. Enterprises to achieve effective digital transformation should inevitably leverage the latest RPA technology-based bot-led testing to validate fully functional software bots. These bots ensure enterprise-wide digitalization at a faster and quicker pace when compared to other methods.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Keeping these above facts in mind, let us have a sneak peek into this recently concluded webinar<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It has been an exciting and captivating webinar on Bot-led testing jointly hosted by TestingXperts and UiPath Test Suite.
