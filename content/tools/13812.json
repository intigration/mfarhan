Typically, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/test-automation-in-agile\/ca-en\">agile and DevOps practices<\/a> on the go, the process of software testing has taken a shift-left approach. This method of testing ensures software testing to be taken up along with the development and both run in parallel from the initial stages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"contentlist\">\r\n<strong>Table of Contents<\/strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><a href=\"#AI bots and Software Testing\">AI bots and Software Testing<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence in Software Testing\">The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence in Software Testing<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#What is a bot and what is special about AI Bot in software testing?\">What is a bot and what is special about AI Bot in software testing?<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#How AI powered bots can be used in software testing\">How AI powered bots can be used in software testing<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#Conclusion\">5.

This sort of testing at the last phase of SDLC led to many missed project timelines and adversely affected cost also. But, today with continuous integration, continuous testing and continuous delivery embedded in DevOps, software testing has taken a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Why-is-shifting-left-the-right-thing-to-do-in-QA\">shift-left approach<\/a> as stated above and slowly moved from manual testing towards test automation. In order to get effective test automation, the QA team uses both open source and paid machine learning test automation tools that are widely available.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence in Software Testing\"><\/a><strong>The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence in Software Testing<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Artificial-Intelligence-and-Its-Impact-on-the-Software-Testing-Industry\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13869\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Artificial-Intelligence-in-Software-Testing.jpg\" alt=\"Artificial Intelligence\" width=\"401\" height=\"401\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It has also been observed that, though enterprises could get many benefits by leveraging test automation such as faster and continuous releases and quality products. But, still their quest for quicker ROI and need for complete automation without human intervention has led to the innovation of AI.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Subsequently, today the era of Intelligent AI-driven software testing has come into place. This AI is an umbrella term for the set of algorithms and technologies that enable computer systems to perfectly mimic human intelligence. A broad range of these algorithms have been developed using Robotics, Machine learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Cognitive computing, etc. and interestingly all of these form a part of the AI technology.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Specifically, today\u2019s automation testing deals with AI and Machine Learning (ML) wherein the usage of ML allows computers to learn automatically without any human intervention. Interestingly, AI machine learning involves the development of unique and specific algorithms that can access data, learn from that data by extracting patterns to make decisions and predictions and seemingly these patterns form the inputs for the AI chat bots.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbestechcouncil\/2018\/12\/17\/ai-in-software-testing-will-a-bot-steal-your-spot\/#22ab3c5d3671\">Forbes<\/a> in one of its Article on AI bots says that, \u201cDevelopment teams no longer have the luxury of time they had when monthly product launches were the gold standard. Today\u2019s enterprises demand weekly releases and updates that trickle in even more frequently. In this context of tightening deadlines where the bar is always set higher, the only real alternative is to test faster and smarter using AI. Machine learning and other branches of AI will significantly alter the way software testing is conducted.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is a bot and what is special about AI Bot in software testing?\"><\/a><strong>What is a bot and what is special about AI Bot in software testing?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13871\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ai-powered-bots.jpg\" alt=\"ai powered bots\" width=\"401\" height=\"401\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is important to note that with respect to software testing, most of the activities are repetitive as the product or application features need to be tested many times.

This process stands out to be the best and effective candidate for applying AI machine learning and invariably these inputs and the expected outcomes are the main criteria that are needed to train an AI Bot.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AI bot is nothing but a shortcut for an <strong>AI Chat bot<\/strong> named as Bot and it is being used to simulate human conversation or chat with users enabled through AI. These AI bots work like humans and ensure automation of tasks to save lot of time and costs.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Significantly for the AI bots to work in software testing you need to define the specific goals for which they can be used. QA team should know how AI works to take the complete advantage of using these AI bots in the process of software testing. These intelligent bots need to act independently and an AI bot autonomy is the result of using control loops.
