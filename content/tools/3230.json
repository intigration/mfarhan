There are various tools available to assure security into the systems, but they are still not to the point of being the only route to test. These security and compliance issues are seen as road blocks that slow down the deployment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>According to a recent study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, people experience decision fatigue when asked to make more security decisions than are manageable.\u00a0 <\/em><\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Security teams of all sizes receive nearly 17,000 alerts every week. This statistic represents that an organization would have to review nearly 1,700 alerts per week with 10 dedicated security personnel.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>According to a study by Ponemon, On an average, 29 percent of all malware alerts received by their security operations team are investigated, and an average of 40 percent are considered to be false positives. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If security teams receive more alerts than they can address, how can we expect them to successfully find the real threat among a huge number of possible threats?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Automated Security Testing is the Solution!\"><\/a><strong>Automated Security Testing is the Solution!<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Automated application security testingcan help in preventing many of the standard attacks , of which SQL injection is one of the examples. These days, an automated tool informing the DevOps team to fix a whole sea of vulnerabilities is considered to be easy than the security team doing the same thing. The burden of informing DevOps team about all the alerts can be reduced by the new automated tools that are getting better day by day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Automation tools not only support in covering the employee time gap but also covers the skills gap. If a tool can check the whole deploy environment for your preferred cloud environment at the time of deployment, it becomes a huge relief for the testers on having complete knowledge about the security features of the given cloud environment. The overall result of automation would increase security position for the business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/devsecops-the-smarter-way-to-ensure-security\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3232\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3232\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/d.png\" alt=\"DevSecOps Way to Ensure Security\" width=\"860\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"TestingXperts\u2019 Solution- DevSecOps\"><\/a><strong>TestingXperts\u2019 Solution- DevSecOps<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all are aware of the importance of security of our organizations.
