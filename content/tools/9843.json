This type of testing helps in finding vulnerabilities of admin credentials, wireless protocols, and wireless access points.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>Physical Penetration Testing:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>This type of penetration testing is practiced in order to stop the unauthorized control or access on the physical components such as sensors, cameras, motion detectors, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>Application Penetration Testing:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>This testing practice discovers the security threats and weak points in a web application. It is the process that simulates the app from attacks by monitoring the systems and firewalls.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>Social Engineering Test:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>This testing practice will help an enterprise to find the threat actors who are trying to lure the employees with the methods of manipulation or influence for achieving control over system and enterprise\u2019s sensitive data.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>Network Penetration Testing:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>In this testing method, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses in network infrastructure are identified. This method performs a thorough examination on several software packages such as MySQL, File transfer protocol, SQL server, Secure Shell (SSH), etc.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) testing:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>This method of testing is performed in both ways, i.e. using automated tools and manual methods.

The DoS formats can occur in various formats such as half-open SYN attack, resource overload, flood attacks, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pen-tester is likely to make use of the standard hacking tools to check for vulnerabilities. However, various challenges are involved with the traditional pen testing model, which is the reason, companies are moving towards the new <strong>Pen Testing as a Service<\/strong> model comprising of data, technology, and talent to eliminate the security challenges for modern applications.

A traditional penetration testing services is a point in time evaluation. However, PTaaS involves a continuous cycle of testing and remediation. It suggests that to combat the changing security stance of the company, there must be an on-going program of testing and management. The PTaaS methodology recognizes, tests and validates the entire platform stack. From the operating system to the SSL certificate, PTaaS is about creating a system of automatic checks and monitoring to protect the smallest features of the software eco-system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Major Benefits of Penetration testing Services?\"><\/a><strong>Major Benefits of Penetration testing Services?<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#8211; Continuous Security Management: <\/strong>\r\n\r\nPTaaS encompasses continuous security management through all-encompassing managed services<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#8211; Frequent Vulnerability Scanning: <\/strong>\r\n\r\nUnlike the traditional penetration testing, in PTaaS, you can receive access to regular vulnerability scanning report<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#8211; Automatic Track Changes: <\/strong>\r\n\r\nPTaaS comprises of an automatic track changes feature that would ensure traceability of improvements in the application security.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/5-Reasons-Why-Penetration-Testing-is-Important\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13963\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/penetration-testing-benefit.jpg\" alt=\"penetration testing benefit\" width=\"848\" height=\"388\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What are the tools for Pen testing?\"><\/a><strong>What are the tools for Pen testing?<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p><h3><strong>OWASP:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>The Open Web Application is a non-profit organization that is running several projects to improve the security of software.
