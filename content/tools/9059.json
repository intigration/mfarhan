In fact, 2017 has been one of the worst years to experience two big ransomware in a row. \u2018WannaCry\u2019 and \u2018Petya\u2019 are the two most prominent ransomware attacks that shook the entire world.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; WannaCry swept Asia and Europe rapidly, locking up critical systems such as the UK\u2019s National Health Service, a huge telecom company in Spain, and other such businesses and institutions around the world, all in the fastest time. If reports are to be believed, the motive of WannaCry ransomware was not to make money but to produce a random disruption across the globe. This massive cyber-attack has hit at least 150 countries and infected 300,000 machines. The victims included universities, hospitals, manufacturers and government agencies in countries like China, Britain, Germany, Russia, and Spain.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; Petya, another recent cyber-attack hit companies across the USA and Europe. Petya was publicized to be more deadly than the \u2018WannaCry&#8217; cyber attack. With Petya, the victims were unable to unlock their computers in spite of paying the ransom. Petya attack impacted various services, and industries and Ukraine had turned out to be the epicenter of this attack. The Petya attack impacted companies across all sectors such as pharmaceuticals, shipping, hospitals, law firms and much more.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"TestingXperts\u2019 Security Testing Approach: \u2018Tx-Secure\u2019 (TestingXperts\u2019 Security Testing Framework)\"><\/a><strong>TestingXperts\u2019 Security Testing Approach: \u2018Tx-Secure\u2019 (TestingXperts\u2019 Security Testing Framework)<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After all these incidents, it is evident that such attacks will not stop but only grow.\u00a0 Companies and individuals today are under extreme pressure to build software\/applications that are thoroughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/How-cyber-Security-Testing-Can-Help\" >tested for their security<\/a> and are, at the same time, competent enough to alert users against any possible cyber-attack.
