Such method of software testing at the end of the SDLC does not hold good anymore and with Agile and DevOps methodologies on the go.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nWhen the testing process actually starts at the beginning of the code development stage, it is specifically referred to as Shift-left approach wherein testing goes hand in hand with development, in an order of Continuous Integration (CI) \/Continuous Delivery (CD) method.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nEvidently, with testing in parallel to code development under DevOps methodology, it suffices the CI, CD and Continuous Testing (CT) process. But, still organizations today face a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/evolving-from-quality-assurance-to-quality-engineering\/\">Quality Assurance<\/a> (QA) challenges such as time constraints in development and test cycles while manually testing diverse applications.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nHence, the most efficient way to deal with testing applications is to adopt a well-integrated and robust test automation solution that can predict and simulate business scenarios. It should be coupled with an appropriate test automation strategy in agile, approach and a well-defined test automation framework to deliver quality software at speed under agile and DevOps environments.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Role of Test Automation in Agile and DevOps&lt;\"><\/a><strong>Role of Test Automation in Agile and DevOps<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Agile Environment\"><\/a><strong>Agile Environment<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\r\nUnder an agile environment with iterative &amp; an incremental model in place, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/test-automation-guide\">Test automation<\/a> delivers quality at speed within sprints, as functionality can be developed and tested rapidly. It is common that agile teams are spread across geographies and setting of infrastructure across, becomes a costly deal. But, cloud-based test automation tools allow the teams to access the tool from any device and collaborate towards achieving the end goal for delivering a quality product.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nIt has also been observed that under agile scenarios, the number of tests continues to increase exponentially across each iteration and an automation tool would efficiently handle it and ensures early to the market. Moreover, under Agile, you can automate your functional and regression tests to ensure the product performs quickly and exactly as per the requirements.\r\n\r\n<p><\/p><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What are 5 Ways to Make Test Automation Successful in Agile?\"><\/a><strong>What are 5 Ways to Make Test Automation Successful in Agile? <\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p><h3><strong>Implement Parallel Testing:<\/strong><\/h3><p><\/p>\r\nIn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/agile-methodology\">agile methodology<\/a>, continuous releases in multiple iterations could cause the test automation teams to miss the quality standards. By following parallel testing with the development cycles, it helps to identify the bugs, fix the issues and test them effectively. This will be an efficient way to increase productivity and avoid last-minute surprises.<p><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Adopt the Right Automation Tool:<\/strong><\/h3><p><\/p>\r\nIt is essential to select and invest in the right automation tool by validating the tool capabilities. It is necessary to ensure whether the selected automation tool meets the expected features or criteria for successful test automation under an agile environment.<p><\/p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/4-Easy-Ways-to-Maintain-Test-Automation-Suites\"><strong>Maintain smaller test cases:<\/strong><\/a><\/h3><p><\/p>\r\nIt is important to run test cases that are small. This will eliminate the unnecessary data which might not add any difference with or without the addition of the data to the test case. In addition to this, smaller test cases help to make changes easily according to the <a title=\"Regression Testing Guide \u2013 Tools, Types and Techniques\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/regression-testing\">regression testing<\/a> requirements.<p><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Monitor the Development Environments:<\/strong><\/h3><p><\/p>\r\nIt is crucial to continuously monitor the developers and development environment to understand the functionality. There are a number of phases in a software development process &#8211; it comprises of a network, back-end to front-end system architecture, etc. Hence, it is important to understand the functionality and their association with product development. This will help to focus on the product quality rather than finding the bugs through different data.<p><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Implement Quality Tests:<\/strong><\/h3><p><\/p>\r\nDeveloping robust tests is an important factor to make test automation successful in agile. This will help the developers to create quality scripts that can easily integrate with the regression testing. The test scripts should be flexible to fulfil the regression testing requirements by meeting the criterion of accuracy, portability, integrity, portability, performance, etc.<p><\/p>\r\n<p><\/p><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"DevOps Environment\"><\/a><strong>DevOps Environment<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>To achieve speed and agility in DevOps, it is important to\u00a0automate\u00a0all the\u00a0testing\u00a0processes and configure them to run automatically when the deployment is completed in the\u00a0QA Environment. Specialized\u00a0automation testing\u00a0tools and continuous integration tools should be used to achieve this integration to deliver quality.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nAs DevOps embraces a culture shift, it breaks silos to build, test and deploy applications, in order to achieve quality with reduced deployment times. Automation tools play an important role to achieve the implementation of CI\/CD\/CT. Thus,\u00a0Test automation\u00a0is undoubtedly the secret to the success of DevOps.\r\n\r\n<p><\/p><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What are the Best DevOps Practices to Follow?\"><\/a><strong>What are the Best DevOps Practices to Follow?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p><h3><strong>Consider Infrastructure as Code (IaC):<\/strong><\/h3><p><\/p>\r\nThis practice is used in various phases of DevOps. It is used for automating the infrastructure that is required for releasing software. Usually, the infrastructure code is added by the developers from their existing development tools.<p><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Practice Continuous Integration (CI):<\/strong><\/h3><p><\/p>\r\nWithin this practice, tools related to configuration management (CM) are brought together with the development tools to trace out whether the code which is being developed is ready for production or not. This practice involves continuous feedback from the testing and development teams, and thus it becomes easier to solve the issues related to code.<p><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Implement Test Automation:<\/strong><\/h3><p><\/p>\r\nTo achieve quality code, it is essential to implement the practice of regular testing. In DevOps test automation, developers can fix the errors in the code in the development phase itself. Hence, implementing test automation in the DevOps framework will speed up the SDLC. Also, there will not be any need to perform repetitive test cases to prevent the bugs.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/the-benefits-of-test-automation-in-salesforce\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-10541\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-10541 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Salesforce-automation-blog.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Salesforce-automation-blog-300x61.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Salesforce-automation-blog-768x156.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Salesforce-automation-blog.jpg 849w\" alt=\"salesforce automation testing\" width=\"849\" height=\"173\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Major Benefits of Test Automation\"><\/a><strong>Major Benefits of Test Automation<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Delivers accurate test results and ensures quality deliverables\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Facilitates automating maximum steps that can be possibly automated\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Increases the speed of test execution\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Provides rapid feedback to reduce the cost of fixing defects quickly and efficiently\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Saves time enormously due to shorter test cycle times\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Removes tedious tasks with the automation of such tasks\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Frees up manual testers (team members) who can be utilized for other tasks\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Ensures all measures to maximize benefits, while minimizing costs\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Parallel execution of tests helps in reducing time-to-live, which in turn is the crux of a successful DevOps implementation\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u2013 Test automation also plays an important role in Shift-Left approach, as it unlocks continuous testing throughout the SDLC reducing the feedback loop and costs associated with testing\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13801\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/agile-devops-test-automation.png\" alt=\"agile devops and test automation\" width=\"768\" height=\"426\" \/><\/center><p><\/p>\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nThe software testing process has been taking a shift-left approach for a while now, wherein testing is executed in parallel\u00a0with the development leveraging the\u00a0CI\/CD approach.
