Simply put, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/enable-continuous-testing-with-shift-left-and-shift-right-approach\/\">shifting left<\/a> is positioning a process that is performed later in the development cycle to a point early in the delivery lifecycle. The main objective of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Why-is-shifting-left-the-right-thing-to-do-in-QA\">shift left<\/a> concept is to start building more effective and easier-to-manage processes while also saving more time too.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"The Benefit of Shifting Left\"><\/a><strong>The Benefit of Shifting Left<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The traditional waterfall methodology taught us not to start the next step of the development cycle until the previous steps were accomplished; the real <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/4-Major-Benefits-of-Software-Testing-in-the-Healthcare-Industry\">testing of the software<\/a> was initiated after the development was completed. However, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Shift-Left-and-Shift-Right-Testing-Approach-for-Quality-and-Agility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new shift left approach<\/a>, testing is initiated with the development process itself. The traditional waterfall methodology could cause problems for an organization as the discovery of any major bugs at a later stage can activate the need for major code refactoring.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By addressing issues at the point of origin, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Why-is-shifting-left-the-right-thing-to-do-in-QA\">shifting left<\/a> clearly has a better ROI. In contrast to the traditional development method, there is a dedicated team for quality. The main objective of this mode of operation is to respond to issues, not necessarily preventing them.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Why Shift-Left in Security?\"><\/a><strong>Why Shift-Left in Security?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The benefits described are not just limited to the testing process but can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/DevSecOps-Automating-Security-into-the-Testing-Process\">boost the security of an application<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Why-is-shifting-left-the-right-thing-to-do-in-QA\">Shifting security left<\/a> in the real world is like creating a fire escape strategy. In the software security world, it is a threat modeling plan before the coding begins, educating and training developers on securing the coding practices.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/The-Significance-of-Application-Security-Testing-in-Preventing-Cyber-Attacks\">application is continuously assessed for security<\/a> issues from the outset of development, it is extremely unlikely that a major security concern would arise toward the delivery pipeline. It is more likely that only trivial security distresses would exist as the application development process comes to closure. This is a direct outcome of\u00a0placing\u00a0discernibility into the application\u2019s quality by constantly validating that security standards are being employed properly.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The objective is to move the application quality and security concerns closer to the developer, i.e. to the \u201cleft\u201d of the delivery chain in order to avoid any potential issues and resolve them sooner, ideally before the code is finalized. Technology undoubtedly makes shift-left easier. However, it can only help in fighting half the battle.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How to Effectively Shift Security to the Left?\"><\/a><strong>How to Effectively Shift Security to the Left?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the help of the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/services\/security-testing\/\">shift-left security testing approach<\/a><\/strong>, software is developed with security as a design principle and software-defined platforms as enablers.

Incorporate application security into the development tools\r\n<\/strong>\r\nIncorporate security evaluations in the current development tools by integrating them with static analysis tools that automatically\u00a0perform\u00a0static analysis and code reviews.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>2. Appoint security champions\r\n<\/strong>\r\nAppoint or nominate developers (who have some interest in security) as security champions to promote the security message at a peer level.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>3. Incorporate application security into the production phase\r\n<\/strong>\r\nAs security does not stop at the deployment level, a well-planned application security solution must facilitate closed-loop feedback from production. This feedback should be utilized to improve a shift-left security approach.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<strong>4.
