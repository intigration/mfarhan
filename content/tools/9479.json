To exterminate these disadvantages and to bring <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Is-Limited-Agile-Maturity-Hurting-your-Development-and-Testing-Process\">agility into the process<\/a>, automation is required.

This advancement in technology has been named as Infrastructure as Code (IAC). As the name suggests, infrastructure as code is the practice of considering infrastructure as if it were code. This innovative concept helps in managing the operations environment in the similar way you do applications or other code for release. It brings about repeatable, consistent practices for provisioning and changing systems and its configuration.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Why Infrastructure as Code?\"><\/a><strong>Why Infrastructure as Code?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s businesses need an extra responsive IT environment; they demand the capability to change and adapt the IT functionality to support the business\u2019 changing needs in a better way.
