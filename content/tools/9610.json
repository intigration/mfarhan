For software to be failsafe, QA or software testing is important, and hence, outsourcing this task to a specialist company eases the burden to a great extent. Earlier, outsourcing was just a technique used to cut down costs. However, in recent times, it has become an effective strategy for achieving better business objectives.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"contentlist\">\r\n<b><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Contents<\/span><\/b>\r\n<a href=\"#Factors To Consider Before Outsourcing QA Services\">1.

Moreover, by outsourcing, companies can massively reduce their QA costs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -50px;\" name=\"Factors To Consider Before Outsourcing QA Services\"><\/a><strong>Factors To Consider Before Outsourcing QA Services<\/strong><\/h1><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2><font size=\"4\"><strong>1. Know about the verticals which the QA Company has experience<\/strong><\/font><\/h2><\/p> A business\/client\/enterprise looking out for a testing services company specialized in outsourcing must have a vivid idea about the industries they have worked for. The more the industry verticals, the better the QA Company is equipped to solve complex testing issues and thus can provide seamless software testing solutions to the outsourcer.\r\n<p><h2><font size=\"4\"><strong>2. Understand what are the technologies the QA Company has hands-on<\/strong><\/font><\/h2><\/p> Businesses thinking to go with outsourcing their projects must know well in advance as to what kind of technologies and tools the testing services company implements in a real-time environment. Another question that should pop up in their mind whether these technologies and tools are the latest ones and trending in the marketplace.\r\n<p><h2><font size=\"4\"><strong>3. Thorough research about the company<\/strong><\/font><\/h2><\/p> Businesses must do the necessary research to be well-acquainted with the company\u2019s offering. Some of the areas where the businesses can get an understanding of the QA Company\u2019s services offered, industries served, business model, clients served, testing products developed, engagement models, etc.\r\n<p><h2><font size=\"4\"><strong>4. Understanding operational models of Onsite\/Offshore models<\/strong><\/font><\/h2><\/p> Businesses should check whether the testing services company can provide onsite and offsite services.\r\n<p><h2><font size=\"4\"><strong>5. In-depth subject knowledge from an implementation perspective<\/strong><\/font><\/h2><\/p> Businesses must get to know whether the testing services company is really passionate, devoted and committed towards their domain. This also means whether the company enables the latest testing frameworks, methodologies and deployment scenarios from the inside out.\r\n<p><h2><font size=\"4\"><strong>6. Understand the cost factor<\/strong><\/font><\/h2><\/p> Just because the cost of outsourcing is comparatively less doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a win-win situation. More than the cost factor, businesses must focus on the quality of the deliverables. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -50px;\" name=\"Benefits of Outsourcing QA Services\"><\/a><strong>Benefits of outsourcing QA Services:<\/strong><\/h1><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9613\" <img src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/outsourcing-qa-services.jpg\" alt=\"outsourcing-qa-services\" width=\"848\" height=\"388\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14026\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"4\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Quality and productivity\"><\/a><a style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Quality and productivity:<\/strong><\/a><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For an unbiased evaluation of the software, it is essential that businesses assign the development and testing work to different teams. A single team for both development and testing will generate a lack of objectivity. Moreover, by doing so, companies put themselves at risk of not being able to find errors in the software. Having two different teams for both roles will ensure unbiased testing. Therefore, outsourced software testing to a specialist company that has expertise in testing software\/ applications will be the best decision.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"4\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Security of code\"><\/a><a style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Security of code:<\/strong><\/a><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By outsourcing software testing process, companies will have utmost security as they do not have to share the details of the code with their outsourcing partners. In fact, software testing companies prefer to be compliant with the latest regulations and international standards like ISO and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

As a matter of fact, QA is essential for delivering an excellent piece of software. Partnering with an outsource QA team will keep companies in a safer zone, as well as allow them to detect bugs early on in the process. As the cost of defects increases with the development of the project, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Agile-Distributed-Teams-An-Inevitable-Reality-of-Today\">QA process must be agile<\/a> and should start with the development process itself.<\/p>\r\n<p><font size=\"4\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Faster testing results\"><\/a><strong>Faster testing results:<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By outsourcing the QA process, the turnaround time of defect detection also decreases, making the process faster and effective. There are various models followed by the testing companies, and Follow the Sun is the most effective and efficient out of these. In this model, if the client is in some other time zone, the right QA team makes sure the time zone difference does not hamper the efficiency of the process, and the testing results are thus delivered overnight.<\/p>\r\n<p><font size=\"4\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Understanding of the modern QA trends\"><\/a><strong>Understanding of the modern QA trends:<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Specialized QA companies are evolving rapidly and are always updated with the latest quality assurance trends.
