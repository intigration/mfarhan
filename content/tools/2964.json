It is the prime reason that organizations are focusing on automating their build, delivery, and integration processes but still having trouble with test planning and automation. In this article, we will discuss the essential elements needed for continuous testing and how continuous testing can help speed up the software delivery process.<\/p>\r\nIn order to accelerate the software delivery process, an organization should re-evaluate their current testing practices. Organizations must consider the re-engineering software quality process as they jump to transform into continuous testing.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Continuous Testing Elements\"><\/a><strong>Continuous Testing Elements:<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/web-application-automated-testing\" >Automated Testing:<\/strong> There are multiple applications<\/a> on which complex systems are built, and all these applications tend to exchange information via different platforms. Considering manual <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Is-Limited-Agile-Maturity-Hurting-your-Development-and-Testing-Process\" >testing for these applications can slow down the process<\/a> considerably. To prevent delay, testing with functional automation can help alleviate the challenges associated with testing the integrated applications in the complex system.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Service Virtualization:<\/strong> Organizations can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/The-Crucial-Role-of-Service-Virtualization-for-Continuous-Delivery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leverage service virtualization and continuously validate changes<\/a> to bring higher quality products to market rapidly at a lower cost.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Risk Assessment:<\/strong> Organizations can assess the project risk upfront and measure whether they have done enough testing before going into production. Some points that can be considered during the risk assessment process are technical debt, business-related risks, and coverage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Shift-Left:<\/strong> Organizations tend to implement <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/4-Easy-Ways-to-Maintain-Test-Automation-Suites\" >automated test suites<\/a> via a user interface as soon as the application is deployed.
