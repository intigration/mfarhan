This is exactly why many companies have begun to embrace automated technologies. <em>As per a report by <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.transparencymarketresearch.com\/test-automation-market.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Transparency Market Research<\/a>,\u00a0<\/strong>the global test automation market will likely to expand at a robust CAGR of 15.4% from 2017 to 2025 to become worth US$ 109.69 bn by 2025 from US$ 30.45 bn in 2016<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"5\"><h1><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Automation Testing\"><\/a><strong>Automation Testing<\/strong><\/h1><\/font>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Automation is reducing the impending software issues and is deemed critical to the success of many software development teams that uses it. However, a common misconception is considering automation as a silver bullet for achieving instant quality. Teams start expecting 100% coverage, no maintenance, and supreme quality delivered overnight from their automation suites. Often there are many clear cases of executing Test Automation only to improve testing speed and quality.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fact is automated test suites might not make your testing easier, sometimes, it can increase the maintenance burden of your suites. Maintaining a <strong>Test Automation <\/strong>suite without ambiguous targets leads to high cost, incompetence to acclimate to change, and failure to recognize the expected ROI.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-10062\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/inner-diagram-01.jpg\" alt=\"Automation &amp; QA testing Services Ideal Suites\" width=\"848\" height=\"479\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Ways to Setup and Maintain Ideal Automation Suites\"><\/a><strong>Ways to Setup and how to maintain automation scripts<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Clear Test Data Management Approach\"><\/a><strong>1. Clear Test Data Management Approach<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the biggest challenges test engineers face is handling the test data in automated tests, especially in end-to-end test automation. Frequent changes in the data can make scripts fail. Every time a change is made to the application, it is important to refresh the database, change its status and run the scripts to avoid script failure. With this elementary approach, the refresh data source works with a few test suites, applications, and environments. Another way to avoid this situation is to build a new set of data every time you run the scripts. A clear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/4-Trends-Driving-an-Effective-Test-Data-Management-Strategy\">test data management approach<\/a> can help in maintaining the test automation suite and contribute to bring a clear ROI.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Regular health check of automation suites\"><\/a><strong>2. Regular health check of automation suites<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even minor changes can impact an automation suite if the test engineer is not aware of those changes. To avoid any challenges while the tests are running, get regular health checks of the automation suites. Regular checks will ensure automation suites perform as anticipated and give the best results.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Impact analysis of any new enhancement in the application\"><\/a><strong>3. Impact analysis of any new enhancement in the application<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Impact analysis is a significant aspect of responsible Requirements Management. It provides an accurate understanding about the implications of a proposed change in an application, and how it may affect the application. This helps the teams make informed business decisions about the relevant changes to approve. The analysis inspects the proposed change to recognize modules to be created, modified, or rejected and to estimate the effort associated to implement the change. Missing on an impact analysis will not change the size of the task, but it is advised to avoid turning scope into a surprise. Based on the analysis, QA should be planned to update the impacted automated scripts during the sprints itself.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Automate at API level\/ lesser UI automation\"><\/a><strong>4. Automate at API level\/ lesser UI automation<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">UI tests remain the most common type of automation that the test engineers perform. Most agile teams prefer UI-level automation. However, within a few months they start the automation, the teams often realize the cost of maintaining UI-level tests is comparatively greater than the benefit from the automation. So, test engineers are advised to automate their application at the API level because performing automation at application code not just saves on TCO but also increases the durability of scripts.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Robotic-Process-Automation-A-Revolution-in-the-Software-Testing-Industry\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-10063\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-10063\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Robotic-Process-Automation-RPA-A-Revolution-in-the-Software-Testing-Industry-Updated-01.jpg\" alt=\"Robotic Process Automation and Software testing \" width=\"849\" height=\"173\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>\r\n<h3><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To enable your testing efforts, automation of the test suites will be the best solution.
