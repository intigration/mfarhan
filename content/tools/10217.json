With digital advances such as mobility, analytics, smart embedded devices, and social media, executives in all industries are able to improve their use of traditional technologies such as ERP. These digital advancements have been enhancing internal processes, customer relationships, and value propositions. Seeing how rapidly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Testing-Strategies-to-Overcome-Digital-Disruption-in-the-Banking-Sector\">digital technology disrupted<\/a> the media industries in the past, other industries have also started to embrace digitalization for creating a competitive advantage. Let\u2019s understand the term digitalization.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"What is Digitization\"><\/a><strong>What is Digitization<\/strong><\/h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many people confuse digitalization with digitization. Digitization is about ones and zeroes whereas digitalization is fundamentally vast concerning how businesses and lives are transformed bringing technology and people closer. Digital business applies extraordinary amalgamations of new technologies to generate more value and revenue. Digital services, products, and customer experiences conducted through digital channels adds value to the businesses. Various factors prove the significance of digitalization in today\u2019s world.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Businesses are being reborn digital<\/p>\r\n<p>2. Consumers are embracing digitalization<\/p>\r\n<p>3. Technology outbursts are leading to digitalization<\/p>\r\n<p>4. The IT world is moving primarily towards digitalization<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Role of QA\"><\/a><strong>Role of QA<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The digital economy is transforming the way businesses are being run, causing substantial shifts in the way QA is done. Assurance has taken center stage for attaining nearly flawless system performances in security and user experience. Digital assurance is not only testing applications across SMAC (social, mobile, analytics, and cloud) but also assuring the desired business outcomes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/Accelerate-Digital-Transformation-by-Reinventing-Testing\" title=\"Accelerate Digital Transformation by Reinventing Testing\">digital transformation initiatives<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Briefly, QA should be able to support all digital initiatives. Digital assurance solutions must surpass functional validation of SMAC and incorporate network capability, performance, interoperability, and security aspects. Digitalization has shifted the focus entirely from traditional testing towards assurance of integrated testing of embedded devices, software, big data and most importantly customer experience. QA process requires some modifications to keep up with the digital landscape, a few ways by which these changes can be made are given below.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. QA should adopt a DevOps Model for Agile Delivery:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organizations have high expectations that the DevOps will accelerate digital transformation, as it broadcasts a collective IT lifecycle methodology across testing, development, business, and operative teams. Continuous delivery indicates application changes are made recurrently.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Small changes allow less service disruption. DevOps model, therefore, requires QA to collaborate with development for continuous integration, to contribute in the operation phase for engaging with the business to support business-assurance activities and for monitoring and validation. These shifts will allow QA to assure agility.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">New Blog by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/TestingXperts?src=hash\">#TestingXperts<\/a>: The Crucial Role of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/QA?src=hash\">#QA<\/a> in the Era of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Digitalization?src=hash\">#Digitalization<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/72xpQiMNLb\">https:\/\/t.co\/72xpQiMNLb<\/a><\/p>\r\n\u2014 TestingXperts (@TestingXperts) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TestingXperts\/status\/828591213578158084\">February 6, 2017<\/a><\/blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><script src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2.
