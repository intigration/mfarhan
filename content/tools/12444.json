This advancement in technology has been named as Infrastructure as Code (IAC). As the name suggests, infrastructure as code is the practice of considering infrastructure as if it were code. This innovative concept helps in managing the operations environment in the similar way you do applications or other code for release. It brings about repeatable, consistent practices for provisioning and changing systems and its configuration.\"} \r\n    }]\r\n  }\r\n<\/script>\r\n\r\nThe next-generation infrastructure management technologies are transforming the way we manage IT infrastructure.
