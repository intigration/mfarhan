Conclusion<\/a><\/p>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Automation has always been interesting, as it reduces the mundane testing efforts and accelerates the testing process. These days, almost every organization is automating test cases. However, the ROI is not always well anticipated. Often, the tools are blamed for the negative ROI, yet the real reason associated with failed test automation are the long hours required to create the test automation suite, the need for specialized development resources, the difficulty of scripting and maintenance, the lack of test data management strategy, and a lack of involvement of the subject matter experts.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -50px;\" name=\"Challenges Involved with Automation in Testing\"><\/a><h2><strong>Challenges Involved with Automation in Testing<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Traditional test automation techniques sometimes turn out to be ineffective in meeting the business demands of rapid application delivery and quicker time-to-market, resulting in a new set of challenges. Here are some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/avoid-test-automation-challenges\" title=\"How to Avoid Common Test Automation Challenges and Failures?\">main test automation challenges<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; Lack of quicker feedback: <\/strong>\r\nIn traditional QA methods, the scripts are developed only after the application is built and stabilized. Early feedback, which is essential for the reduction of the cost of quality in Agile development, is thus rarely available.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; Substantial upfront investment:<\/strong>\r\nLarge upfront investments are needed due to complex scripting environments and tools, also large investments are needed for test infrastructure, and hiring and training of skilled resources.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; Maintenance issues:<\/strong>\r\nConsidering that development teams are increasingly reliant on process automation, automation components need to transform regularly and consistently in response to changes in the application under test. The subsequent expenses arising in maintaining these scripts take away the advantages that automation can bring.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&#8211; Change of focus:<\/strong>\r\nThe prime objective of the testing team has moved from testing the functionality of the application to the technical development and execution of scripts.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Minimum stakeholder contribution: In conclusion, the key holdups in adopting traditional QA methods are the issues faced by functional and business teams in understanding automation scripts. Extra effort is required to make them available to non-technical users, leading to reduced collaboration between the functional specialists and automation teams.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/6-Recommendations-for-Driving-Business-Value-from-Test-Automation\">6 Recommendations for Driving Business Value from Test Automation<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Scriptless Test Automation\"><\/a><\/span><h1><strong>Scriptless Test Automation<\/strong><\/h1><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the solutions to maximize the scalability of test automation is scriptless test automation.\u00a0 Scriptless test automation enables the testers and business users to automate test cases without worrying about the coding. It helps to achieve faster results and reduces the time expended to understand the code.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the approach of Scriptless test automation, the complete software development process can speed up. The method allows enterprises to participate in test automation and increases the scope of code reusability. Adopting the scriptless framework, it will ease the development teams to overcome the biggest challenge of spending more time at the script development. Also, the methodology helps to simplify the test automation complexity for enterprises.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach for automation will not only help the enterprises to reduce the team\u2019s time and efforts, but it will also ensure to maintain quality and ease in achieving their requirements. The major benefits of scriptless automation are outlined in detail below.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Benefits of Scriptless Test Automation\"><\/a><h2><strong>Benefits of Scriptless Test Automation<\/strong><\/h2><\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>A catalyst between business analysts and technical experts:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>The scriptless nature of the tests enables the participation of business users and serves as a facilitator for communication between business analysts and technical experts.

Using scriptless automation, the testing team can automate large test suites rapidly. The speed of delivery, as well as the go-to-market time, improves rapidly. Besides this, it decreases the time spent on automation. This ensures early detection of bugs during the software development lifecycle.<\/p>\r\n<p><h3><strong>Eradicates technical obligation:<\/strong><\/h3><\/p>\r\n<p>Integrating smarter framework design upfront can eradicate the future costs that arise from augmented script maintenance effort.
