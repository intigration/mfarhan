Although both metrics are used to evaluate the quality of application code, code coverage is a term to describe what percentage of the application code is exercised when a user is interacting with the application. Test Coverage, on the other hand, is testing every business requirement at least once and is clearly a QA team activity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><font size=\"5\"><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"How to attain more Test Coverage in less time\"><\/a><strong>How to attain more Test Coverage in less time<\/strong><\/h2><\/font><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Testers are always running on a tight schedule and have to focus on ensuring maximum coverage within the stipulated time primarily.
