Keeping up the pace can present challenges and leave many uncertain of how to continue. This is where the need for re-inventing software testing arises.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Reinventing the software testing process is essential for achieving the speed and agility that is required to succeed in the digital future. This has become an easy method for organizations that are looking to move forward in the digital world and accelerate innovation while improving cost-effectiveness and reducing business risks.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The question remains- how does an organization get there?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Few organizations have the amenities and the knowledge of building a new quality process from scratch. However, most need to address extremely complex systems and monitoring requirements in the transition phase in order to avoid disruption to business-critical operations. So how do you rearrange your established quality process with the firm drive towards continuous everything?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Answer- Leveraging Continuous Testing<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Continuous Testing leverages agile approach and methodology to execute end-to-end testing of applications. The goal is to facilitate continuous delivery with continuous quality and quicken time to market.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Advantages of Moving Forward with Continuous Testing\"><\/a><strong>Advantages of Moving Forward with Continuous Testing<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9903\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/B-1.jpg\" alt=\"Continuous testing and integration benefits for QA Company\" width=\"848\" height=\"360\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Identifies defects\/bugs faster, driving cost-effectiveness<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Software testing and development approaches are transformed to identify bugs faster and reduce business risks. Continuous Testing makes the software development process collaborative and open to change in the production environment. It helps in to identify defects quicker in the overall software development lifecycle, making the process cost-effective.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Quickens the release cycle, driving competitive advantage<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Continuous Testing shortens the development cycle time, thereby increasing the frequency of releases. This helps companies to reach faster to the market. The teams can release the minimum viable product (MVP) at any point during the project.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Jumpstarts DevOps approach<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Continuous Testing is the initial step towards driving the DevOps approach. It boosts continuous feedback that is crucial for the DevOps<\/a> approach to display noticeable results. DevOps is primarily an organization\u2019s cultural shift towards collaboration between the development teams and operations teams. This boosts continuity and accelerates the development cycle. Continuous Testing and DevOps together helps in making the process quicker and seamless.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Empowers experimentation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Businesses are implementing digital technologies to get more responsive and efficacious in the competitive marketplace. They are bringing a change from the legacy systems and are transforming. Continuous Testing encourages collaboration between developers and testers within the development environment. This collaboration also enables team members in devising efficient ways of implementing certain features. Continuous testing also promotes experimentation, helping the teams experience immediate success.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/How-DevOps-and-Continuous-Testing-will-Impact-2018\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-9904\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9904\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/C-1.jpg\" alt=\"Continuous testing services &amp; DevOps impact on QA testing\" width=\"849\" height=\"173\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Conclusion\"><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The new digitally-driven era needs an improved approach in terms of speed and agility<\/a>.
