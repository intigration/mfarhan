It is implemented and integrated with other applications in one or many ways, such as a web portal, web services, security, service cloud, outbound messaging, Apex programming, social media, data loader, and more. But, in many of these integrations, testing is often neglected because of budget and time constraints. This negligence results in a poor quality product, sub-optimal performance, customer dissatisfaction and an overall increase in quality costs.

For example, if an enterprise aims to perform regression or UAT testing, then it is essential to have experts who are good at regression and <a title=\"What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \u2013 A Detailed Guide\" href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/uat-testing\">user acceptance testing<\/a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>Begin testing early in the SDLC:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt is essential to involve software testers from the very beginning in the SDLC. By involving the teams from the beginning, it will help the teams to understand the software requirements and as well help to identify the issues at the earliest. Also, this will help in reducing future risks. This is an effective way for the QA teams to improve the test coverage and perform more number of tests as the QA team gets exposed to the application early during SDLC.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>Choose a proper testing tool:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere a number of salesforce test automation tools available to perform effective Salesforce automation testing. Hence, before choosing a tool, it is essential for the teams to verify whether the tool is capable to manage during the critical scenarios and meet the requirements or not. Also, it is important to check if the tool is capable to provide the required simulators to test the app functionality or not.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>Include Classes and Controllers:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the development phase of Salesforce, adding classes and controller files in each function helps to make coding more easy, organized, portable, and reusable. Though this is not an efficient way for a developer, but this will help to achieve portability if the test code is in its original class and controller code. Also, this will help not to miss any test classes while migrating from sandbox to production.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>Make Use of Proper Naming for Test methods:<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBefore planning to begin any test method in salesforce automation testing, it is important to save the test method with proper naming. The naming of the test method should include three parts, i.e. the name of the method, information about the Testpath, and the condition on which the method is being performed. This will effectively help the testers to understand the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/types-of-software-testing\">type of test method<\/a> or the test case it is before opening it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Top benefits of test automation in Salesforce\"><\/a><strong>Top benefits of test automation in Salesforce<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/test-automation-salesforce\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13942\" src=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/test-automation-in-salesforce.png\" alt=\"salesforce automation testing\" width=\"848\" height=\"479\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1.

This not just slows down the delivery cycle, but affects the overall quality of testing. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.testingxperts.com\/blog\/test-automation-guide\">automation in testing<\/a> you will be able to increase speed, efficiency and reduce testing costs.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Improved test coverage<\/strong>\r\n\r\nEnterprises should be able to tackle changes that come with their cloud-based applications and releases. This requires sufficient test coverage, which includes the execution of hundreds of test cases, exercise user scenarios, validate edge cases and more. A data-driven test automation in Salesforce ensures seamless applications\u2019 compatibility and consistent performance.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Error-free test cases<\/strong>\r\n\r\nExecuting repetitive tasks continuously via a manual approach is prone to human errors. Automated testing alleviates repetitive testiwhile increasing performance of the applications that are integrated with Salesforce, improves accuracy of tests and ultimately enables testers to focus on risk analysis and exploratory testing.\r\n\r\n<strong>4.
